For the purpose of order fulfillment, we may share your personal information related to order fulfillment, such as shipping address, contact information, with Whaleco Inc.'s subsidiaries and affiliates. Other unrelated personal information will not be shared. These subsidiaries and affiliates either follow the same practices described in this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.
Service providers. 
Third parties that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Service or our business (such as hosting, information technology, customer support, email delivery, order fulfillment and delivery, marketing, consumer research and website analytics).

Advertising and analytics partners. 
 Third-party advertising, marketing, and analytics companies for the interest-based advertising and analytics purposes described in our 
Cookie and Similar Technologies Policy

Your Controls and Choices
 section, the 
US Privacy Notice Addendum for US Residents

Cookie and Similar Technologies Policy

If you revoke our ability to access information from a third-party platform, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.

Cookie and Similar Technologies Policy

Children
Temu does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use our Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are under the age of 13 through the Service. If we become aware that we have unintentionally collected personal data from a child under the age of 13 through the Service, we will delete the information from our records.

Data Security and Retention
The security of your personal information is important to us. We use technical and administrative measures to help protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We also follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) in handling your credit card information. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies.
We generally retain personal information to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, as well as for the purposes of satisfying any U.S. legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we may either delete it, anonymize it, or isolate it from further processing. 
Data of Temu U.S. users will be stored by default in the infrastructure of Microsoft Azure or a similar cloud service provider in the U.S. Temu is a global one-stop shopping destination, therefore where necessary, Temu may transfer data related to order fulfillment to service providers in other countries to provide order fulfillment and logistics services. Sensitive personal information (such as account and profile information) unrelated to fulfillment services will not be transferred. At the same time, in all cases, we will ensure that all transfers of personal data comply with applicable U.S. legal requirements.

They include messages you send through our chat functionality when communicating with merchants who sell goods to you, and your use of virtual assistants when purchasing items through the Platform. That information includes the content of the message and information about the message, such as when it was sent, received, or read, and message participants. Please be aware that messages you choose to send to other users of the Platform will be accessible by those users and that we are not responsible for the manner in which those users use or share the messages.
Information, including text, images, and videos, found in your device’s clipboard, with your permission. For example, if you choose to initiate information sharing with a third-party platform, or choose to paste content from the clipboard onto the Platform, we access this information stored in your clipboard in order to fulfill your request.
Purchase information, including payment card numbers or other third-party payment information (such as PayPal) where required for the purpose of payment, and billing and shipping address. We also collect information that is required for extended warranty purposes and your transaction and purchase history on or through the Platform.

Advertisers, measurement and other partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of the Platform, such as your activities on other websites and apps or in stores, including the products or services you purchased, online or in person. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Platform with your TikTok account.

 TikTok Advertiser Tools
 (such as TikTok Pixel).
We may obtain information about you from certain affiliated entities within our corporate group, including about your activities on their platform.
We may receive information about you from others, including where you are included or mentioned in User Content, direct messages, in a complaint, appeal, request or feedback submitted to us, or if your contact information is provided to us.

Automatically Collected Information
We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Platform, including internet or other network activity information such as your IP address, geolocation-related data, unique device identifiers, browsing and search history (including content you have viewed in the Platform), and

If you are still using an older version that allowed for collection of precise or approximate GPS information (last release in August 2020) and you granted us permission to do so, we may collect such information.
Image and Audio Information. 
We may collect information about the videos, images and audio that are a part of your User Content, such as identifying the objects and scenery that appear, the existence and location within an image of face and body features and attributes, the nature of the audio, and the text of the words spoken in your User Content.

Metadata.
 When you upload or create User Content, you automatically upload certain metadata that is connected to the User Content. Metadata describes other data and provides information about your User Content that will not always be evident to the viewer. For example, in connection with your User Content the metadata can describe how, when, where, and by whom the piece of User Content was created, collected, or modified and how that content is formatted. It also includes information, such as your account name, that enables other users to trace back the User Content to your user account. Additionally, metadata includes data that you choose to provide with your User Content, e.g., any hashtags used to mark keywords to the video and captions.

Data Security and Retention
We use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.
We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Platform and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing the Platform, and enhancing its safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defense of legal claims.
The retention periods are different depending on different criteria, such as the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information. For example, when we process your information such as your profile information to provide you with the Platform, we keep this information for as long as you have an account. If you violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other conditions or policies, we may remove your profile immediately, but may keep other information about you to process the violation.

Brazil
If you are using our Services in Brazil, the following additional terms apply:
Exercise of data protection rights.
 Brazilian law provides certain rights to individuals with regard to their personal data. Thus, we seek to ensure transparency and access controls in order to allow users to benefit from the mentioned rights.
We will respond and/or fulfill your requests for the exercise of your rights below, according to the applicable law and when applicable, to the Brazilian General Data Protection Law - LGPD:

withdrawal of your consent;
request an analysis of decisions taken exclusively based on the automated processing of personal data that affect your interests, including decisions taken to define your personal, professional, consumer or credit profile, or aspects of your personality.
Verifying your identity.
 For your safety and to allow us to make sure that we do not disclose any of your personal data to unauthorized third parties, in order to verify your identity and guarantee the adequate exercise of your rights, we may request specific information and/or documents from you before we can properly respond to a request received concerning your data. All data and documents received from you in the process of responding to your requests will be used for the strict purposes of analyzing your request, authenticating your identity, and finally responding to your request.
Limitations to your rights.
 In certain situations, we may have legitimate reasons not to comply with some of your requests. For instance, we may choose not to disclose certain information to you when a disclosure could adversely impact our business whenever there is a risk of violation to our trade secrets or intellectual property rights. In addition, we may refrain from complying with a request for erasure when the maintenance of your data is required for complying with legal or regulatory obligations or when such maintenance is required to protect our rights and interests in case a dispute arises.

Whenever we transfer your personal data to third parties located in other countries, we will ensure that these companies comply with applicable data protection laws and we will take all measures that are reasonably necessary to ensure the existence of adequate safeguards to protect your personal data and to ensure that it is processed safely.
Language.

Privacy policy
Updated
November 14, 2023
Effective: January 31, 2024
We’ve updated our Privacy Policy below. These updates do not apply to individuals located in the European Economic Area, UK, and Switzerland.
 
If you reside in those areas, 
this version
 of our Privacy Policy applies to you.
We at OpenAI OpCo, LLC (together with our affiliates, “OpenAI”, “we”, “our” or “us”) respect your privacy and are strongly committed to keeping secure any information we obtain from you or about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to Personal Information we collect from or about you when you use our website, applications, and services (collectively, “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to content that we process on behalf of customers of our business offerings, such as our API. Our use of that data is governed by our customer agreements covering access to and use of those offerings.
For information about how we collect and use training information to develop our language models that power ChatGPT and other Services, and your choices with respect to that information, please see 
this help center article
.
1. Personal information we collect
We collect personal information relating to you (“Personal Information”) as follows:

In addition, the companies that host our social media pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics about our social media activity.
Other Information You Provide
: We collect other information that you may provide to us, such as when you participate in our events or surveys or provide us with information to establish your identity (collectively, “Other Information You Provide”

Cookies
: We use cookies to operate and administer our Services, and improve your experience. A “cookie” is a piece of information sent to your browser by a website you visit. You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. However, refusing a cookie may in some cases preclude you from using, or negatively affect the display or function of, a website or certain areas or features of a website. For more details on cookies, please visit 
All About Cookies
.
Analytics
: We may use a variety of online analytics products that use cookies to help us analyze how users use our Services and enhance your experience when you use the Services.
2. How we use personal information
We may use Personal Information for the following purposes:

To carry out business transfers; and
To comply with legal obligations and legal process and to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or other third parties.
Aggregated or De-Identified Information
. We may aggregate or de-identify Personal Information so that it may no longer be used to identify you and use such information to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, to improve and add features to our Services, to conduct research and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may analyze the general behavior and characteristics of users of our Services and share aggregated information like general user statistics with third parties, publish such aggregated information or make such aggregated information generally available. We may collect aggregated information through the Services, through cookies, and through other means described in this Privacy Policy. We will maintain and use de-identified information in anonymous or de-identified form and we will not attempt to reidentify the information, unless required by law.
As noted above, we may use Content you provide us to improve our Services, for example to train the models that power ChatGPT. Read 
our instructions
 on how you can opt out of our use of your Content to train our models.
3. Disclosure of personal information
In certain circumstances we may provide your Personal Information to third parties without further notice to you, unless required by the law:
Vendors and Service Providers
: To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, we may provide Personal Information to vendors and service providers, including providers of hosting services, customer service vendors, cloud services, email communication software, web analytics services, and other information technology providers, among others. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process, or store Personal Information only in the course of performing their duties to us.
Business Transfers
: If we are involved in strategic transactions, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, or transition of service to another provider (collectively, a “Transaction”), your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed in the diligence process with counterparties and others assisting with the Transaction and transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that Transaction along with other assets.
Legal Requirements
: We may share your Personal Information, including information about your interaction with our Services, with government authorities, industry peers, or other third parties (i) if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) if we determine, in our sole discretion, that there is a violation of our terms, policies, or the law; (iv) to detect or prevent fraud or other illegal activity; (v) to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our products, employees, or users, or the public, or (vi) to protect against legal liability.
Affiliates
: We may disclose Personal Information to our affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with OpenAI. Our affiliates may use the Personal Information we share in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Business Account Administrators
: When you join a ChatGPT Enterprise or business account, the administrators of that account may access and control your OpenAI account. In addition, if you create an account using an email address belonging to your employer or another organization, we may share the fact that you have an OpenAI account and certain account information, such as your email address, with your employer or organization to, for example, enable you to be added to their business account.
Other Users and Third Parties You Share Information With
: Certain features allow you to display or share information with other users or third parties. For example, you may share ChatGPT conversations with other users via shared links or send information to third-party applications via custom actions for GPTs. Be sure you trust any user or third party with whom you share information.
4. Your rights
Depending on location, individuals may have certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Information. For example, you may have the right to:
Access your Personal Information and information relating to how it is processed.
Delete your Personal Information from our records.
Rectify or update your Personal Information.
Transfer your Personal Information to a third party (right to data portability).
Restrict how we process your Personal Information.
Withdraw your consent—where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing at any time. 
Object to how we process your Personal Information.
Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
You can exercise some of these rights through your OpenAI account. If you are unable to exercise your rights through your account, please submit your request through 
privacy.openai.com
 or to 
dsar@openai.com
.
A note about accuracy: Services like ChatGPT generate responses by reading a user’s request and, in response, predicting the words most likely to appear next. In some cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that ChatGPT output contains factually inaccurate information about you and you would like us to correct the inaccuracy, you may submit a correction request through 
privacy.openai.com
 or to 
dsar@openai.com
. Given the technical complexity of how our models work, we may not be able to correct the inaccuracy in every instance. In that case, you may request that we remove your Personal Information from ChatGPT’s output by filling out 
this form
.
For information on how to exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the internet to train our models, please see 
this help center article
.

Exercising Your Rights.
 To the extent applicable under local law, you can exercise privacy rights described in this section by submitting a request through 
privacy.openai.com
 or to 
dsar@openai.com
.
Verification.
 In order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, change, or deletion, we may require you to verify your credentials before you can submit a request to know, correct, or delete Personal Information.

6. Children
Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. OpenAI does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to OpenAI through the Service, please email us at legal@openai.com. We will investigate any notification and if appropriate, delete the Personal Information from our systems. If you are 13 or older, but under 18, you must have permission from your parent or guardian to use our Services.
7. Links to other websites
The Service may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by OpenAI, including social media services (“Third Party Sites”).

By providing these links we do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed these sites. Please contact the Third Party Sites directly for information on their privacy practices and policies.
8. Security and Retention
We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect Personal Information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Service or email. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service, or third-party websites.
We’ll retain your Personal Information for only as long as we need in order to provide our Service to you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations. How long we retain Personal Information will depend on a number of factors, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, our purpose for processing the information, and any legal requirements.
9. International users
By using our Service, you understand and acknowledge that your Personal Information will be processed and stored in our facilities and servers in the United States and may be disclosed to our service providers and affiliates in other jurisdictions.
Legal Basis for Processing

Performance of a contract with you when we provide and maintain our Services. When we process Account Information, Content, and Technical Information solely to provide our Services to you, this information is necessary to be able to provide our Services. If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to provide our Services to you. 
Our legitimate interests in protecting our Services from abuse, fraud, or security risks, or in developing, improving, or promoting our Services, including when we train our models. This may include the processing of Account Information, Content, Social Information, and Technical Information. Read 
our instructions
 on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for 
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can 
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which 
ads you’ll find most useful
, 
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with 
unique identifiers
 tied to the browser, application, or 
device
 you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as 
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with 
personal information
 that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a 
phone number
 or 
payment information
 to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and 
devices
 you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes 
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including 
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and 
referrer URL
 of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an 
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your 
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, 
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve 
synced with your Google Account
If you use our 
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other 
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or 
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can 
turn your Android device’s location on or off
 using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on 
Location History
 if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about 
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from 
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to 
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide 
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including 
cookies
, 
pixel tags
, local storage, such as 
browser web storage
 or 
application data caches
, databases, and 
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to 
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to 
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to 
make improvements
 to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and 
customized search results
. For example, 
Security Checkup
 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you 
personalized ads
 based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in 
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on 
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to 
link information
 about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the 
safety and reliability
 of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or 
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us 
detect abuse
 such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use 
algorithms
 to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may 
combine the information we collect
 among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, 
your activity on other sites and apps
 may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the 
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our 
Product Privacy Guide

Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your 
Google Account
 includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether 
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

cookie
 in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services 
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can 
modify location settings
 on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in 
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you 
use Google Home to make a reservation
 through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to 
review and manage third party apps and sites
 you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any 
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators

For external processing
We provide personal information to our 
affiliates
 and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Meet any applicable law, regulation, 
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our 
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, 
our users
, or the public as required or permitted by law.
We may share 
non-personally identifiable information
 publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to 
show trends
 about the general use of our services. We also allow 
specific partners
 to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like 
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and 
2 Step Verification
 to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your 
personal info
 or the content you create or upload, like 
photos
 and 
documents
. You can also delete 
activity information
 saved in your account, or 
choose to have it deleted automatically
 after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as 
advertising data

We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s 
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain 
servers around the world
 and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain 
legal frameworks
 relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
U.S. state law requirements
Some 
U.S. state privacy laws
 require specific disclosures.
This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:
We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in 
Information Google collects
.
We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in 
Why Google collects data
.
We explain when Google may disclose information in 
Sharing your information
. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
We explain how Google retains information in 
Retaining your information
. You can also learn more about 
how Google anonymizes data
. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.
U.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Finally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.
We describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google’s services in 
Your privacy controls
. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as 
export and download
 a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting 
My Ad Center
.
When you use these tools, we’ll validate your request by verifying that you’re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also 
contact Google
. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.
We also provide 
more information
 on Google’s handling of CCPA requests.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in ""local storage"" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about 
how Google uses cookies
 and how Google uses data, including cookies, 
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a 
Google Account
 and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about 
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
 is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
 is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
 is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
 is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about 
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be 
managed
 in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at 
My Activity
.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more 
about Google ads
 and 
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about 
Google Play Services
.
combine the information we collect
Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. 
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. 
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. 
Learn more
If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. 
Learn more
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can 
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can 
search and browse privately
 or turn off 
signed-out search personalization
.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share. 
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including 
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. 
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our 
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. 
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. 
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. 
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. 
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. 
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. 
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your 
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. 
Learn more
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. 
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like ""Cooking and Recipes"" or ""Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we 
require the same from advertisers
 that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about 
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located 
around the world
 to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. 
Learn more
specific Google services
For example, you can delete 
your blog
 from Blogger or 
a Google Site you own
 from Google Sites. You can also delete 
reviews
 you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. 
Learn more
 about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. 
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you 
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about 
requests to remove content
 from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
U.S. state privacy laws
These laws include:
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA);
Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA);
Colorado Privacy Act (CPA);
Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring (CTDPA); and
Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. 
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your 
account settings
 and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

 about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.

Telegram Privacy Policy






1. Introduction


This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc. 
(“Telegram”)
, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the 
“Services”
). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, 
‘we’
, 
‘us’
 and 
‘our’
 refers to Telegram, and 
‘you’
 refers to you, the user of the Services.


1.1 Privacy Principles


Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:




We don't use your data to show you ads.


We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.




1.2. Terms of Service


This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at 
https://telegram.org/tos
. This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.


1.3. Table of Contents


This Privacy Policy explains the following:




the legal basis for processing your personal data;


what personal data we may collect from you;


how we keep your personal data safe;


what we may use your personal data for;


who your personal data may be shared with;
 and 


your rights regarding your personal data.




1.4. EEA Representative


If you live in a country in the 
European Economic Area
 (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services. However, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated a third party, European Data Protection Office (EDPO), as our 
representative
 pursuant to Article 27 of the GDPR. You can direct to EDPO any of your GDPR-related queries:




by using EDPO’s online request form at 
https://edpo.com/telegram-gdpr-data-request/
 or


by writing to EDPO at Avenue Huart Hamoir 71, 1030 Brussels, Belgium.




2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data


We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: 
(1)
 providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and 
(2)
 to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.


3. What Personal Data We Use


3.1. Basic Account Data


Telegram is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.


To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your 
username
 (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like. 


We do 
not
 require your screen name to be your real name. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name. This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).


3.2. Your Email Address


When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.


From September 2022, we may ask some users to provide an email address to receive login codes via email instead of SMS (with an option to use 'Sign in With Google' / 'Sign in with Apple'). In this case, we will receive an email address which will be stored separately from the recovery email, and will only be used to send you authentication codes when you log in to your account. The login email address will be stored until it is changed or the account is deleted.


3.3. Your Messages


3.3.1. Cloud Chats


Telegram is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your 
cloud chats
 on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.


3.3.2. Secret Chats


Secret chats
 use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is 
no way
 for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent 
to
 or 
from
.


3.3.3. Media in Secret Chats


When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. They can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.


3.3.4. Public Chats


In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups. All public chats are cloud chats (see 
section 3.3.1 above
). Like everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.


3.4. Phone Number and Contacts


Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.


We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.


Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the approximate number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram. When you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram. 


You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings.




If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG). If you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code. Telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.




3.5. Location Data


If you share a location in a chat, this location data is treated like other messages in 
cloud
 or 
secret chats
 respectively.


If you share your 
Live Location
 in any chat or turn on 
’Make Myself Visible’
 in 
People Nearby
, Telegram will use your data to display your location to those users with whom you are sharing it, even when the app is closed – for as long as you keep these optional features activated.


3.6. Cookies


The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web. We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising. The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience. Your browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.


4. Keeping Your Personal Data Safe


4.1. Storing Data


If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands. These are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space. However, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram. As such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers. All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.


4.2. End-to-End Encrypted Data


Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see 
section 3.3.2
 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your 
Telegram Passport
 are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient. Before this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient. While Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information. In this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.


4.3. Retention


Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.


5. Processing Your Personal Data


5.1. Our Services


Telegram is a cloud service. We will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.


5.2. Safety and Security


Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations. Telegram also has more than 
700 million
 users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers. To improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent 
spam
, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc. If collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.


5.3. Spam and Abuse


To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients. If a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently. You can send an appeal using 
@Spambot
. In case of more serious violations, your account may be banned. We may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.


5.4. Cross-Device Functionality


We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see 
section 5.5
 below) that work across all your devices.


5.5. Advanced features


We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features. For example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen. To do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently. A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”). To turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.


5.6. No Ads Based on User Data


Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes. Telegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service. 


Telegram offers a 
tool
 for advertisers to promote their messages in 
public one-to-many channels
, but these sponsored messages are based solely on the topic of the public channels in which they are shown. No user data is mined or analyzed to display ads or sponsored messages.


6. Bot Messages


6.1. Ecosystem


Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create 
bots
. Bots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special 
“inline”
 interface to access their features. By performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.


6.2. How Bots Can Receive Data


You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:




By sending messages to a bot.


By using an 
inline bot
.


By participating in a group with a bot.


By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.


By paying for goods and services via bots (see 
section 7
 below).




6.3. What Data Bots Receive


In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see 
section 3.1
 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).


Bots can also receive the following data when you 
interact
 with them.




Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.


If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads). 


If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.


When you start your message with the username of an 
inline bot
 (e.g. 
@gif
) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot. This query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service. We will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.


Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or 
without access
. If the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group. The interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.




6.4. Bots Are Not Maintained by Telegram


Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram. They are completely independent from us. They should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.


7. Third Party Payment Services


7.1. Payment Information


The 
Payment Platform for Bots
 is available to users as of 
Telegram 4.0
. Telegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world. It is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details. Neither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information. Although we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram. Please study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them. 


7.2. Credit Card Information


When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server. Your credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers. We do not access and do not store your credit card information. When you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a 
token
 that you can reuse for future payments. It is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.


7.3 Shipping Information


When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer. We can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases. We will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.


7.4. Clearing Payment Information


You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment & Shipping Info’. If you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.


7.5. Payment Disputes


Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.


8. Who Your Personal Data May Be Shared With


8.1. Other Telegram Users


Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA. Note that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk. 


8.2. Telegram’s Group Companies


To provide, improve and support our Services, we may share your personal data with: 
(1)
 our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands, 
(2)
 Telegraph Inc., a group member also located in the BVI; and 
(3)
 Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai. We will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data. This will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies. If you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact our EEA representative using the details in 
section 1.4
 above.


8.3. Law Enforcement Authorities


If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities. So far, this has never happened. When it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: 
https://t.me/transparency
.


8.4. Translation of Chats, Channels and specific Messages at the Request of the User


Users can choose to translate a specific text message into a different language by tapping “Translate” in the action menu of the message (to enable this option, a user should first turn on Translation services in the Settings > Languages section of the Telegram application). Telegram Premium users can also optionally enable automatic live translation on any chat, group or channel.


Since Telegram may rely on a third-party, Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, for automatic translation of messages, the text of any message or set of messages that users choose to translate may be shared with Google in order to obtain their translated versions. Google will only access the data to provide a translation and will not use it for any other Google products, services, or advertising.


8.5. Transcription of Voice and Video Messages at the Request of the User


Some users can choose to convert a voice or video message to text by tapping on the Voice-to-Text icon (“->A”) displayed on eligible messages (to be able to use this option, users should subscribe to Telegram Premium in the Settings > Telegram Premium section of the Telegram application). 


Since Telegram may rely on a third party, Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, for voice-to-text conversion, the 
audio data
 of voice and video messages that users choose to convert to text may be shared with Google in order to obtain their transcribed versions. Only audio data may be shared for this purpose (no other data, such as the user's IP address or any information about their account is shared). According to the agreement between Telegram and Google, Telegram will pay for the transcriptions on behalf of its users and Google will only access the audio data to provide a transcribed version – it will not log audio data or transcripts, and will not use the data for any other Google products, services, or advertising.


9. Your Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us


9.1. Your Rights


Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data. You have a right to: 
(1)
 request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller; 
(2)
 delete (see 
section 10
 below) or amend your personal data; 
(3)
 restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data; 
(4)
 correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you; and 
(5)
 lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.


9.2. Exercising Your Rights


If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly use the contact details in 
section 12
 below.


9.3. Data Settings


You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in 
Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings
 (using one of our mobile apps). 


Sadly, if you're not OK with Telegram's modest minimum requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services. You can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the 
deactivation page
.


10. Deleting data


10.1. Accounts


If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the 
deactivation page
. Deleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.


10.2. Messages




In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.


In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending. Otherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history. This means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.


As of 
version 5.5
, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides. There is no time limit. Any party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, regardless of how many messages are retained by either of the participants.


In 
supergroups
 and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants. Note that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the 
admins log
.




10.3. Self-Destructing Messages


Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to 
self-destruct
. As soon as such a message is 
read
 (2 checks appear), the countdown starts. When the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.). Media with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews. The timer is triggered when they are viewed.


10.4. Account Self-Destruction


By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. You can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.


11. Changes to this Privacy Policy


We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page 
www.telegram.org/privacy
. Please check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.

How We Use Your Information
Snap and Ads
Privacy Policy
Effective: August 15, 2023
Snap Inc.
 is a technology company. Our products and services — including Snapchat, Bitmoji, Spectacles and other hardware, advertising, commerce, and others that link to this Privacy Policy — provide fast, fun, and personalized ways to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together! 
When you use these services, you’ll share some information with us. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, how it’s shared, and the controls you have.
We’ve done our best to write this Privacy Policy in a way that’s easy to understand for all our users and free of difficult language and legal phrases. If you want to review something later on, you can always take a look at our 
Privacy Center
. We designed it to give you easy-to-digest summaries of our privacy practices. For example, our 
Privacy by Product
 page gives product-specific information and links to support pages with tips and tricks. Still have questions? Just 
reach out
 to us.
Information We Collect
There are three basic categories of information we collect:
Information you provide.
Information we get when you use our services.
Information we get from third parties.
Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.
Information You Provide
When you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us. For example, many of our services require you to set up an account, so we’ll need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number, and date of birth. We may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar. And if you’re using our commerce products to buy something, like those latest sneakers, we may ask for your payment information, like a debit or credit card number and associated account information.
Of course, you’ll also provide us with whatever information you send through our services, such as Snaps and Chats, conversations with My AI, Spotlight submissions, Public Profile information, Memories, and more. Keep in mind that the users who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to our services as well: don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.
When you contact Support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.
Information We Get When You Use Our Services
When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Story, watched cat videos on Spotlight, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, explored the Snap Map, and sent a few Snaps. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:
Usage Information.
 We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:
how you interact with our services, such as which Filters or Lenses you view or apply to Snaps, which Stories you watch, whether you’re using Spectacles, your interactions with My AI, or which search queries you submit.
how you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or we detect that you capture a screenshot).
Content Information.
 When you use our services, you may engage with the camera or creative tools and create and share various types of content including Stories, Snaps, and more. We collect information about content you create or provide on our services, and your engagement with the camera and creative tools. For certain content, this may include information based on the content of the image, video, and audio. For example, if you post a Spotlight Snap of you playing basketball, we may show you other Spotlight Snaps about basketball. We may also collect other information about the content, including metadata — which is information about the content itself like the date and time it was posted and who viewed it. 
Device Information.
 We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we may collect:
information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, device usage data, browser type, keyboards installed, language, battery level, and time zone;
information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones, and whether you have headphones connected; and
information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.
Device Phonebook.
 Because our services are all about communicating with friends, we may — with your permission — collect information from your device’s phonebook, such as your contacts and related information.
Camera, Photos, and Audio.
 Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera, photos, and microphone. For example, you won’t be able to send Snaps or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.
Location Information.
 When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location that includes methods such as GPS signals.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.
 Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as advertising and commerce features. For example, we may use information collected on other websites to show you more relevant ads. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our services and your choices, please check out our 
Cookie Policy
.
Log Information.
 We may also collect log information when you use our website, such as:
details about how you’ve used our services;
device information, such as your web browser type and language;
access times;
pages viewed;
IP address;
identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser; and
pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.
Other information, with your permission
. There may be instances when you interact with our services that we will ask your permission to collect additional information. For example, if you want to participate in our 
Made For Me Panel
 or live in a jurisdiction where certain data is considered sensitive we will ask your permission and give you a heads up on what data, including sensitive data, if any, we’re collecting. 
Information We Collect from Third Parties
We may collect information about you from other users, our 
affiliates
, and third parties. Here are a few examples:
If you link your Snapchat account to another service (like Bitmoji or a third-party app), we may receive information from the other service, like how you use that service.
We may obtain information from advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties. We may use this information, among other ways, to help target or measure the performance of ads. You can learn more about our use of this kind of third-party data on our 
Support Site
.
If another user uploads their contact list, we may combine information about you from that user’s contact list with other information we have collected about you.
If you provide us with your contact information, we may use that information and information obtained from third parties to determine if we can communicate with you on other messaging platforms. 
We may receive information from third parties, including website publishers, social network providers, law enforcement, and others, about potential violators of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
How We Use Information
What do we do with the information we collect? For the detailed answer, go 
here
. The short answer is: provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. Here are the ways we do that:
develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services.
provide, personalize, and improve our advertising services, ad targeting, and ad measurement, including through the use of your content and precise location information (again, if you’ve given us permission to collect precise location information), both on and off our services. We may also store information about your use of third-party apps and websites on your device to do this. 
Learn more
. See the 
Control Over Your Information
 section below for more information about our advertising practices and your choices.
add context to your Snapchat experience, for example by tagging your Memories with searchable labels based on your location (of course, if you’ve given us permission to collect your precise location) and the content of your photo or video (for example, if there’s a dog in your photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term “dog”). 
personalize our services
 by, among other things, suggesting friends, place recommendations in Snap Map, profile information, or Cameos stickers, helping Snapchatters find each other in Snapchat, 
affiliate
 and third-party apps and services, inferring your interests based on your content or activity, or customizing the content we show you, including ads.
develop and improve our algorithms and machine learning models, including for personalization, advertising, augmented reality, fairness and inclusivity, and to prevent abuse or other Terms of Service violations. 
conduct research to better understand Snapchatter and general consumer interests and trends, including the ways our services are used. 
use information you provide to communicate with you on other messaging platforms.
enhance the safety and security of our products and services.
verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.
use information we’ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance our services and your experience with them.
enforce, investigate, and report conduct violating our Terms of Service and other usage policies, respond to requests from law enforcement, and comply with legal requirements.
send you communications, including by email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted. For example, we may use email, SMS, or other messaging platforms to respond to support inquiries or to share information about our products, services, and promotional offers that we think may interest you.
monitor and analyze trends and usage.
If you use an Apple device with Apple’s TrueDepth camera, we may use information from Apple’s TrueDepth camera to improve the quality of Lenses. This information is used in real time — we don’t store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.
How We Share Information
Why do we share the information we collect? Most of the time, it’s because you ask us to. Sometimes we share it because we need to. Here are the ways we may share information about you:
With other Snapchatters.
 We may share the following information with other Snapchatters:
information about you, such as your username, name, and Bitmoji.
information about how you have interacted with our services and content you’ve engaged with, such as your Snapchat “score,” the names of Snapchatters you are friends with, how close you are with your friends on Snapchat, whether you’ve recently been active on Snapchat, your recent location history (if you choose to share your precise location on Snap Map), and other information that will help Snapchatters understand your connections with others using our services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Snapchat friends in common or are in the same area.
information about your device, such as the operating system and device type, to help you receive Chats, Snaps, and other content in the optimal viewing format.
any additional information you have directed us to share. For example, Snap will share your information when you connect your Snapchat account to a third-party app, and if you share information or content from Snapchat to the third-party app.
if enabled, we will share your real-time precise location with your selected friends on Snap Map (but only for the duration you have chosen to share it).
content you post or send. How widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using. For example, a Snap may be sent to just a single friend you select, but your Story Snaps may be seen by any Snapchatter you allow to see your Story.
With all Snapchatters, our business partners, and the general public.
 We may share the following information with all Snapchatters as well as with our business partners and the general public:
public information like your name, username, profile pictures, Bitmoji, Snapcode, and Public Profile.
Public Content like your Highlights, Custom Stickers, Lenses, Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone, and any content that you submit to an inherently public service, like Spotlight, Snap Map, and other crowd-sourced services. This content may be viewed, used, and shared by the public at large both on and off our services, including through search results, on websites, in apps, and in online and offline broadcasts.
With our affiliates.
 We may share information with entities within the 
Snap Inc.
 family of companies
.
With third parties. 
We may share information with third parties in the following ways:
We may share information about you with 
service providers
 who perform services on our behalf, including to facilitate payments and measure and optimize the performance of ads and deliver more relevant ads, including on third-party websites and apps.
We may share information about you with business partners that provide services and functionality on our services. For more information about information collected by third parties on our services, visit our 
Support Site
.
We may share information about you, such as device and usage information, to help us and others prevent fraud.
We may share information about you for legal, safety, and security reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.
investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service and Community Guidelines violations.
protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.
detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.
We may share information about you as part of a merger or acquisition. If 
Snap Inc.
 gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.
Non-personal information.
 We may also share with third parties that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us aggregated, non-personally identifiable, or de-identified information.
Third-Party Content and Integrations
Our services may contain third-party content and integrations. Examples include third-party integrations in Lenses, Camera editing tools, to provide Scan results, and third-party developer integrations. Through these integrations, you may be providing information to the third party as well as to Snap. We are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services. You can learn more about third-party services in Snapchat 
here
.
How Long We Keep Your Information
Snapchat lets you capture what it’s like to live in the moment. On our end, that means most messages — like Snaps and Chats — sent in Snapchat will be automatically deleted by default from our servers after we detect they’ve been opened by all recipients or have expired, unless you’ve changed your default settings or decide to save something. Other content, like Story posts, are stored for longer. For the latest information about how long we store different types of content, check out our 
Support Site
.
We store other information for longer periods of time. For example:
We store your basic account information — like your name, phone number, and email address — and list of friends until you ask us to delete them.
We store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use. If location information is associated with a Snap — like those saved to Memories or posted to Snap Map or Spotlight — we’ll retain that location as long as we store the Snap. Pro tip: You can see the location data we retain about you by 
downloading your data
.
If you ever decide to stop using Snapchat, you can just 
ask us to delete your account
. We’ll also delete most of the information we’ve collected about you after you’ve been inactive for a while!
Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. There may be legal requirements to store your data and we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your account, content created by you, or content created with other users is flagged by others or our systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.
Control Over Your Information
We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.
Access, Correction, and Portability.
 You can access and edit most of your basic account information right in our apps. You can also use 
Download My Data
 to obtain a copy of information that isn’t available in our apps in a portable format, so you can move it or store it wherever you want. Because your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number of reasons, including, for example, if the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.
Revoking permissions.
 In most cases, if you let us use your information, you can simply revoke your permission by changing the settings in the app or on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality. For promotional emails and messages sent by SMS or other messaging platforms, you may opt out by clicking on the unsubscribe link or similar mechanism as provided.
Deletion.
 While we hope you’ll remain a lifelong Snapchatter, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go 
here
 to learn how. You can also delete some information in the app, like photos you’ve saved to Memories, your conversations with My AI, Spotlight submissions, and search history.
Advertising Preferences.
 We try to show you ads that we think will be relevant to your interests. If you would like to modify the information we and our advertising partners use to select these ads, you can do so in the app and through your device preferences. Go 
here
 to learn more.
Tracking.
 For users who run devices with iOS 14.5 or more recent, some specific requirements apply. We’ve specified those 
here
. 
Communicating with other Snapchatters.
 It’s important to us that you stay in control over whom you communicate with. That’s why we’ve built a number of tools in Settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to see your Stories, whether you’d like to receive Snaps from just your friends, your friends and contacts, or all Snapchatters, and whether you’d like to block another Snapchatter from contacting you again. Go 
here
 to learn more.
International Data Transfers
We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live. Whenever we share information outside of where you live, when we are legally required to do so, we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place. We also make sure any third parties we share information with have an adequate transfer mechanism in place, as well. You can find more information on the categories of third parties we share information with 
here
.
State and Region Specific Information
You may have specific privacy rights in your state or region. For example, in the United States, residents of California and other states have specific privacy rights. Snapchatters in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and other jurisdictions also have specific rights. We keep an up-to-date overview of state and region specific disclosures 
here
.
Our Audience
Our services are not intended for — and we don’t direct them to — anyone under 13. And that’s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. In addition, we may limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of users under 18. In some cases, this means we will be unable to provide certain functionality to these users.
Updates to the Privacy Policy
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them. In some cases, we may provide different or additional policies or notices about our information practices. For example, if you reside in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia, our

, which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights


about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor and Megaphone.

Your Privacy Controls
.

How?

contact us

Request to know and access the personal data we process about you.

    Please note there are situations where Spotify is unable to delete your data, for example when:




it’s still necessary to process the data for the purpose we collected it for


we have an overriding interest in continuing to process the data, for example where we need the data to protect our services from fraud


Spotify has a legal obligation to keep the data, or


Spotify needs the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if there’s an unresolved issue relating to your account




There are several ways you can delete personal data from Spotify:

support page
. This data includes your User Data, Usage Data and other data listed in 
Section 3 ‘Personal data we collect about you’


you can also 
contact us
 to request deletion or reach out to customer support via our 
chat bot








Right to Opt-Out


Request to opt out of the processing of your personal data for ‘sharing’ or ‘targeted advertising’ purposes, as defined under certain privacy laws. 

    For more information about our processing for these purposes, see the section 
‘Tailored advertising controls’
 below.


You can exercise your right to opt out in your account 
Privacy Settings
 under ‘Tailored Ads’. 

    If you do not have an account or are not logged in, you can also opt-out by clicking the 
'Your Privacy Choices'
 link at the footer of our website.






Data portability


Request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service. 


For information about how to exercise the right to portability, see ‘Know/Access’ above.






Not be subject to automated decision making


Not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making (decisions without human involvement), including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect. 


Spotify does not carry out this type of automated decision making in the Spotify Service.

    You can do this if Spotify is processing your personal data solely based on your consent.


To withdraw your consent, you can:
    


adjust the relevant control on Spotify


contact us










Verifying requests, generally


To verify a consumer request to know, request to delete, and request to correct, we ask you to provide certain details related to your Spotify account. Please note, if you do not have a Spotify account we will not have enough information about you to verify your identity and respond to your requests, as we do not keep sufficient information necessary to re-identify and link you to a prior visit to the Spotify Service where data may have been collected. As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests.


Household requests


If all the members of a household make an access, correction or deletion request, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.


Tailored advertising controls


What is tailored advertising?




This is when we use information about your use of our Services and other websites and mobile apps to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising, targeted advertising, or 'sharing' for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.


An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.




How to control tailored advertising:




You can control tailored advertising in your account 
Privacy Settings
 under 'Tailored Ads'.


If you do not have an account or are not logged in, you can also opt-out by clicking the 
'Your Privacy Choices'
 link at the footer of our website


You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.




If you are 'opted out' of Tailored Ads in your 
Privacy Settings
, you may still get advertising. This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.


Appropriate age for tailored advertising:




The appropriate age for tailored advertising is determined by the country you are in and what rules apply to tailored advertising in that country. You will not receive Tailored Ads unless you have reached the appropriate age.


You will not be able to 'opt-in' to Tailored Ads if you are under the appropriate age.


You will start to receive Tailored Ads once you reach the appropriate age for your country. When this happens, you will receive a message within the Spotify Service to let you know. This message will contain a link to the 
Privacy Settings
 where you can change your preferences or 'opt-out' of Tailored Ads at any time.

6. Data retention


We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:




maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service


making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings


complying with our legal obligations


resolving disputes




Here are some of the categories of our retention periods, and the criteria we use to determine them:




Data retained until you remove it

   It's your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See the section on 'Deletion' in 
Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls'
 for more information, and the circumstances in which we can act on your request.

   You can also delete certain personal data directly from the Spotify Service: for example, you can edit or delete your profile picture. Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses unless one of the limited purposes described below applies.


Data that expires after a specific period of time

   We have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time. For example, personal data you may input as part of search queries is generally deleted after 90 days.


Data retained until your Spotify account is deleted

   We keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. Examples of this include your Spotify username and profile information. We also typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalized recommendations that take listening habits into account (for example, Your Time Capsule or Your Summer Rewind). When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of data is deleted or de-identified.


Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes

   After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be: 
  


to help ensure user safety, or


to protect against harmful content on our platform.






This helps us investigate potential breaches of our 
User Guidelines
 and 
Platform Rules
. On the other hand, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.


7. Transfer to other countries


Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify transfers personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy.


Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law.


We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:




technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymization


policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests




8. Keeping your personal data safe


We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.


We have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies.


To protect your user account, we encourage you to:




use a strong password which you 
only
 use for your Spotify account


never share your password with anyone


limit access to your computer and browser


log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device


read more detail on 
protecting your account




You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on 
your account page
.


If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.


It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalized recommendations and be included in your data download.


9. Children


Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the 
Spotify Kids Privacy Policy
 says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.


The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:




is under the age of 13 years


makes it illegal to process their personal data, or


requires parental consent to process their personal data




We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a 
Spotify Kids
 account.


If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, 
contact us
.


If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.


When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.


10. Changes to this Policy


We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.


When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.


11. How to contact us


For any questions or concerns about this Policy, contact our Data Protection Officer any one of these ways:




email 
privacy@spotify.com


write to us at: Spotify USA Inc., 150 Greenwich Street, Floor 62, New York, NY 10007, USA

 We also obtain information from other sources. We protect this information according to the practices described in this Privacy Statement, plus any additional restrictions imposed by                        the source of the information.

advertisers that run ad campaigns on Netflix (“Advertisers”) that might provide us with: identifiers (for example, cookies or resettable identifiers); and information about your interests, including demographic information                                and your activities online (such as websites visited, apps used and ads viewed);
 
 
 
service providers that facilitate the sale, operations, and management of ads, in the context of our ad supported subscription plans (“Ad Service Providers”);

online and offline information providers to support our ad supported subscription plans;                            
 
 
 
publicly-available sources such as publicly available posts on social media platforms and information available through public databases associating IP addresses with internet service providers (ISPs);
 
 
 
third party services that you are signed into and that provide functions within Netflix games, such as multiplayer gameplay, leaderboards, and game saving options.

We use information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts, to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and select ads in connection with our ad supported subscription plans, to process your                registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. For example, we use such information to:
 
 
 
provide you with customized and personalized viewing recommendations for movies, TV shows, and games we think will be of interest to you (collectively “content”);
 
 
 
determine your general geographic location (such as your city, state/province, and postal code);

help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests;                    
 
 
 
coordinate with Partners on making the Netflix service available to members and providing information to non members about the availability of the Netflix service, based on the specific relationship you have with the Partner;                    
 
 
 
secure our systems, prevent fraud and help us protect the security of Netflix accounts;

analyze and understand our audience, improve our service (including our user interface experiences and service performance) and optimize content or ad selection, recommendation algorithms and delivery;

These communications may be by various methods, such as email, push notifications, text message, online messaging channels, and matched identifier communications (described                        below). Please see the ""Your Choices"" section of this Privacy Statement to learn how to set or change your communications preferences.
 
 
 
Our content recommendations system strives to predict what you will be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, our content recommendations system does not infer or attach socio-demographic information (like gender or race) to you. We                have a Help article that explains how our content recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver of these recommendations is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at 
netflix.com/recommendations
.            
 
Disclosure of Information            
 
We disclose your information for certain purposes and to third parties, as described below:            
 
 
 
The Netflix family of companies: 
We share your information among the Netflix family of companies (
help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo
) as needed for: providing you                        with access to our services; providing customer support; making decisions about service improvements; content development; and for other purposes described in the Use of Information section of this Privacy Statement.                    
 
 
 
Service Providers:
 We use other companies, agents or contractors (""Service Providers"") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you. For example, we engage Service                        Providers to provide marketing, advertising, communications, security, infrastructure and IT services, to customize, personalize and optimize our service, to provide bank account or balance information, to process credit card transactions                        or other payment methods, to provide customer service, to analyze and enhance information (including information about users' interactions with our service), and to process and administer consumer surveys. We engage Ad Service                        Providers in the context of our ad supported subscription plans. In the course of providing such services, these Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information. We do not authorize them to use or disclose                        your personal information except in connection with providing their services (which includes maintaining and improving their services).
 
 
 
Partners:
 As described above, you may have a relationship with one or more of our Partners, in which case we may share certain information with them in order to coordinate with them on providing the Netflix service                        to members and providing information about the availability of the Netflix service. For example, depending on what Partner services you use, we may share information:                    
 
 
 
in order to facilitate Partner pre-paid promotions or collection of payment for the Netflix service for distribution to us;                            
 
 
 
with Partners who operate voice assistant platforms that allow you to interact with our service using voice commands;                            
 
 
 
so that content and features available in the Netflix service can be suggested to you in the Partner’s user interface. For members, these suggestions are part of the Netflix service and may include customized and personalized                                viewing recommendations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Advertisers/Ad Measurement Companies: 
We may share information collected from or about you with Advertisers and/or Ad Measurement Companies to select advertisements, and measure and improve advertising effectiveness.                        As a reminder, please see the Information from Other Sources section above if you have questions regarding the role of Advertisers or Ad Measurement Companies.
 
 
 
Promotional offers:
 We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share                        your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive. Please note that these third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices.
 
 
 
 
 
Protection of Netflix and others:
 Netflix and its Service Providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy any                        applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal                        activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Netflix, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law.                    
 
 
 
Business transfers:
 In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party                        agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement.                    
 
 
 
Whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer personal information to other countries, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Statement and as permitted by the applicable laws on data                protection. You can find out more about how we disclose and transfer your personal information internationally at this link: 
help.netflix.com/legal/personal-information-international-transfers
.            
 
You may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways:            
 
 
 
certain portions of our service may contain a tool which gives you the option to share information by email, text message and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart device;                    
 
 
 
social plugins and similar technologies allow you to share information; and
 
 
 
through Netflix game features, such as multiplayer options and leaderboards.                    
 
 
 
Social plugins and social applications are operated by the social networks themselves, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Similarly, some of the Netflix game features mentioned above (such as multiplayer gameplay,                leaderboards, and game saving options) may require use of a third-party service, which is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy.            
 
Access to Account and Profiles            
 
 
 
“Remember me” function:
 For ease of access to your account, you can use the ""Remember me on this device"" function when you log in to the website. This function uses technology that enables us to provide direct                        account access and to help administer the Netflix service without requiring reentry of any password or other user identification when your browser revisits the service. 
 
 
 
Giving others access to your account:
 If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, account information (including your email address                        or other information in the ""Account"" area of our website), and game related information (such as your in-game name and saved game progress). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature. You might have the                        option to use seamless account login through the Netflix mobile app, which enables login to the Netflix app on smart TVs, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the network to which you are connected. If you use that                        feature, those devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log out of those devices.
 
 
 
Profiles:
 Profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized Netflix experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available                        to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish                        them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection                        and use at the time such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies (
help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy
)). We have various parental controls available,                        you can learn more by reading our Help article located at 
help.netflix.com/node/264
. 
 
 
 
Profile Transfers:
 The profile transfer feature on your account allows you and users with access to your account to transfer an eligible profile from your account to a separate account (including information such as                        viewing history and recommendations). You can change the setting for this feature in the Settings section of your Account page. You can learn more by reading our Help article located at 
help.netflix.com/node/122698
.
 
 
 
Removing device access to your Netflix account:
 To remove access to your Netflix account from your devices, visit the ""Account"" section of our website, choose ""Sign out of all devices,"" and follow                        the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may not occur immediately). Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix                        ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your                        account, including your personal information.
 
 
 
Your Choices            
 
Email and Text Messages.
 If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, simply access the ""Communications Settings"" option in the ""Account"" section of our website                and uncheck those items to unsubscribe. Alternatively, click the ""unsubscribe"" link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related correspondence                from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.            
 
Push Notifications.
 You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. On some device operating systems, you will be automatically enrolled in the notifications. If you subsequently decide you no longer wish                to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off. We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and subsequently decide                you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off. 
 
Matched Identifier Communications from Netflix.
 Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party.                A privacy protective identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier                to identifiers in its database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send a given                promotional communication to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the “Marketing Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website.                
 
 
 
Behavioral Advertising. 
Behavioral advertisements are those that are selected based on your use and/or interactions with various unaffiliated third party apps or websites across the Internet (behavioral advertising). Netflix                can advertise its services using behavioral advertising, and if you are using a browser, then certain cookies and web beacons can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device,                tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine your likely interests. For your choices about behavioral ads from Netflix, please see the ""Cookies                and Internet Advertising"" section (below).            
 
Netflix Ad Supported Subscription Plan - Behavioral Advertising.
 If you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan, we can present you with advertisements, including ones selected using behavioral advertising information.                If you do not wish to be presented with behavioral advertisements as part of your participation in an ad supported subscription plan, you can opt out by:
 
 
 
selecting the appropriate profile; and 
 
 
 
choosing the ""Behavioral Advertising"" section in the ""Account"" section of our website
 
 
 
When you choose to opt out of receiving behavioral ads, you will still see ads, but they will not be selected using behavioral advertising information. Opting out will not limit our collection of information, but will influence how we use                such information. 
 
An option to opt out will not be provided in a Kids profile, because we do not engage in behavioral advertising on Kids profiles.
 
To exercise choice around cookies or resettable device IDs being collected or for any purposes outside of behavioral advertising in our ad supported subscription plan, please utilize the tools in the Cookies and Internet Advertising section                below.
 
Cookies and Internet Advertising
 
We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains                the types of technologies we use, what they do and your choices regarding their use.            
 
Cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers
Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other                technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work                in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.
If you use the Netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may                collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the ""Identifier for                Advertisers"" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the ""Google Advertising ID"" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant                and for analytics and optimization purposes. 
 
Why does Netflix use these technologies?
 
We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to enforce our terms, prevent fraud;                to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site; and to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites. We may                also use these technologies to support the operation of our ad supported subscription plans.
 
To help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device identifiers, please see the information below:
 
 
 
Essential cookies:
 These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use                        our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.                    
 
 
 
Performance and functionality cookies:
 These cookies help us to customize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter                        information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our                        visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.                    
 
 
 
Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers:
 These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver                        ads that are more relevant to you.                    
 
 
 
When we advertise our services on other websites or apps, some of the websites and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our advertisements (collectively                “Advertising Partners”), may receive information from us as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information). Common uses of this type of information                are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service. Another common use is to make sure we do not serve ads trying to get individuals                to sign up for the Netflix service if they are already a Netflix user. Netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs                you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service. 
 
In connection with our ad supported subscription plans, Netflix, our Ad Service Providers, and Ad Measurement Companies can use these technologies to operate and support our ad supported subscription plans, including supporting an Advertiser’s                ad campaigns, measurement, and optimization of the same. 
 
How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?
 
 
 
To exercise choice regarding cookies
For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third                        parties about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for online behavioral advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, 
click here
. At this                        time, we do not respond to web browser ""do not track"" signals. Exercising choice over cookies is specific to that web browser or device. If you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan and wish to exercise your                        choices, you can exercise such choices by accessing the ad supported subscription plan controls described in the section “Netflix Ad Supported Subscription Plan - Behavioral Advertising” above.                    
 
 
 
To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers
To opt out of behavioral ads from Netflix in connection with an resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices,                        please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under ""privacy"" or ""ads"" in your device's settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be selected based                        on your likely interests. Exercising choice over a resettable identifier is specific to that device. If you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan and wish to exercise your choices, you should access the ad supported subscription                        plan controls described in the section “Netflix Ad Supported Subscription Plan - Behavioral Advertising” above.                    
 
 
 
To exercise choice using self-regulatory program resources
Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for behavioral advertising:                    
 
 
 
In the US: 
Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
 
 
 
 
 
To exercise choice regarding other technologies
There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB,                        and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Other technologies,                        such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.

Security            
 
We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security                appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information. Unfortunately, no measures can be guaranteed to provide 100% security. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.            
 
Other Websites, Platforms and Applications            
 
The Netflix service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as the display of social media content, or the provision of voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose                policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours. For example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet                connected devices, or if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan, ads displayed may allow you to interact with them through clicking them. These websites and platforms have separate and independent privacy or data policies,                privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Netflix service.

US State (including California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)) Privacy Notice 
 
This Privacy Notice applies to consumers who reside in states that have adopted consumer privacy laws and supplements the Privacy Statement, to the extent applicable. Because of differences in certain state laws, this supplement is broken                into two sections, California (CCPA) Specific Notices, applicable to California residents only, and a California (CCPA) and other State Specific Sections, that may apply to residents of one or more states with consumer privacy laws requiring                such information. Such states as of the date of this Privacy Notice are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia (collectively “US State Privacy Laws”).
 
California (CCPA) Specific Notices 
 
Personal Information We Collect
 
We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household (“CCPA personal information”). We                collect the following categories of CCPA personal information from consumers:
 
 
 
Identifiers
: “Identifiers” covers a broad range of information, including things like name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and IP address. We collect some CCPA personal information that falls into                        this category. For example, for streaming subscribers we’re going to have an email address, payment information (like a credit card), and for DVD customers we’re going to have a postal address. We collect IP addresses, identifiers                        from the devices you might use to connect, and characteristics about the networks you use when you connect to our service online (see also “Information we collect automatically” above in the Privacy Statement). These sorts of identifiers                        are connected to your Netflix account. There are also identifiers we use for purposes like advertising (resettable device identifiers, third party advertising cookies on our website) that we do not associate with your account,                        but that can be used to reach you with promotional messages on other websites and applications. In addition, there are identifiers (that may or may not be associated with your account) that we use for managing an ad supported subscription                        plan. We will also collect information such as gender, if you join an ad supported subscription plan. 
 
 
 
Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law
: This covers a broad range of information like race, sex, marital status, among other protected classes. We will collect this sort of information                        about you if you choose to participate in our optional research surveys, or other research activity such as an in person interview or panel. We do not collect this information when you register for the Netflix service. This will                        include date of birth and gender if you join an ad supported subscription plan.
 
 
 
Commercial information
: This includes information about products or services considered, obtained or purchased.
 
 
 
Internet or other electronic network activity information
: We offer online services, so we collect CCPA personal information in this category, like your interactions with our service.
 
 
 
Geolocation data
: Our online services don’t collect precise geolocation data from GPS sensors. However, we do collect IP addresses from which we can determine your general location (such as your city, state/province,                        and postal code).
 
 
 
Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory or similar information
: We may collect photos, audio and/or video of you in certain circumstances. For example if you contact customer service, we may record the call (voice                        recording). 
 
 
 
Inferences
: We have a content recommendations system that strives to predict what you’ll be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, we do not have a list in our recommendations system that attaches socio-demographic                        information to you like “soccer dad who likes rom coms” or “financially savvy mom who craves action films” or “singleton high school grad who likes tiny houses.” We have a Help article that explains how our recommendations system                        works - spoilers: the biggest driver is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at 
netflix.com/recommendations
.
 
 
 
Over the previous twelve months, we have collected each of the categories of CCPA personal information described above except the specific pieces of CCPA personal information collected in connection with an ad supported subscription plan (which                has been available for less than twelve months as of the last update of this Privacy Notice).

analyze and understand our audience, improve our service (including our user interface experiences) and optimize content selection, recommendation algorithms and delivery; 
 
 
 
communicate with you concerning our service so that we can send you news about Netflix, details about new features and content available on Netflix, special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys, and to assist you with                        operational requests such as password reset requests. These communications may be by various methods, such as email, push notifications, text message, online messaging channels, and matched identifier communications (described                        below). Please see the ""Your Choices"" section of our Privacy Statement to learn how to set or change your communications preferences.
 
 
 
Over the previous twelve months, we used each of the categories of CCPA personal information listed above for the purposes listed above. However, the specific pieces of CCPA personal information described as being used in relation to an ad                supported subscription plan were not collected or used during the last twelve months (from the last updated date of this Privacy Notice).

Sources of CCPA personal information
 
We explain our sources of information in the Collection of Information section of our Privacy Statement. (Please see that section for more information that may be of interest to you.) For ease of reference, in regard to CCPA personal information                these are:
 
 
 
You (the consumer) when you provide us CCPA personal information directly, and when we collect it automatically based on your interactions with us (for example, through your computer or other Netflix capable device you might use to                        access our service (such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices); 
 
 
 
Partners (other companies with whom you have a relationship). These Partners might include (depending on what services you use): your TV or Internet service provider, or other streaming media device providers who make our service available                        on their device; mobile phone carriers or other companies who provide services to you and collect payment for the Netflix service for distribution to us; voice assistant platform providers who enable interaction with our service                        via voice commands; third party services that you are signed into that provide functions within Netflix games, such as multiplayer gameplay, leaderboards, and game saving options; and 
 
 
 
Other sources. Service Providers who support our business including: security and payment service providers; Ad Service Providers, Ad Measurement Companies, and Advertisers; publicly-available sources, specifically, public posts on                        social media platforms; and information about Internet Service Providers (ISPs) used by members to access Netflix through public databases associating IP addresses with ISPs. 
 
 
 
CCPA Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
 
As of the date of this Privacy Notice, we may use certain types of information to offer members an ad supported subscription plan or engage in certain marketing activities. Under the CCPA, this activity may be considered “selling” or “sharing.”                This section includes important disclosures for California residents. 
 
If you do not wish for us to sell or share CCPA personal information about you, you can learn how to make applicable choices by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link located in the footer of 
netflix.com
                or by visiting this link: 
netflix.com/dnsspi
. Using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” (as defined by the CCPA) personal information, or stop all behavioral                advertising.  
We do not knowingly sell, share or use the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
 
Financial Incentives
 
 
When you subscribe to Netflix you may choose an ad supported subscription plan. It is possible that some may interpret an ad supported subscription plan to fall within the meaning of a “financial incentive” for the purposes of the CCPA.
 
If you choose an ad supported subscription plan, you will receive a discount in the price of your monthly subscription and when you watch content on Netflix, you will be presented ads which may appear before, during, or after content viewed                on Netflix. In certain circumstances some content and features (such as downloading and viewing content in other countries) may not be accessible under an ad supported subscription plan. 
 
If you would like to stop participating in an ad supported subscription plan, you can simply access the Account Settings of your Netflix account through a web browser and select a different plan that is not an ad supported subscription plan.                The monthly fee associated with your Netflix subscription will likely increase if you move from an ad supported subscription plan to one that is not an ad supported subscription plan. We believe the reduction in monthly fee for participation                in an ad supported subscription plan and use of the categories of CCPA personal information described above to present relevant ads to you represents a fair exchange to continue to provide members a high quality service at a lower direct                out of pocket price to members. When considering the size of reduction in monthly fee for participating in an ad supported subscription plan, we considered projected ad revenue generated by all members projected to participate in an ad                supported subscription plan and the overall revenue required by Netflix to operate and innovate its business, produce the content to entertain its members and make a profit.
 
State Specific Sections
 
Sale and Use of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes.
 We may use certain types of information to offer members an ad supported subscription plan or engage in certain marketing activities. This                activity may be considered “selling”, or “targeted advertising” under US State Privacy Laws. Our practices regarding sale or targeted advertising may depend on how you interact with us, the services you use and the choices you make. 
If                you do not wish for us to sell or use your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, you can learn how to make applicable choices by visiting this link: 
netflix.com/dnsspi
.                Using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously sold personal information or stop all behavioral advertising.  
 
We have not sold personal information in the past twelve months. We have also not “shared” or made available personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising in the past twelve months. 
 
Use of De-Identified Information. 
As described in the Your Information and Rights section of our Privacy Statement, we may de-identify personal information in a secure manner when we determine it is appropriate                as part of our business operations. We take reasonable measures to maintain and use the information in a de-identified manner. We do not make any attempts to re-identify such information, except as permitted under applicable law.

You have a right to confirm whether or not we process your personal information as well as to access and receive a copy of the specific personal information we have collected about you. 
 
 
 
You have a right to deletion of your personal information, subject to exceptions under applicable US State Privacy Laws. 
 
 
 
You have a right to request correction of any inaccurate personal information we hold about you.

                        or by visiting this link: 
netflix.com/dnsspi
 
 
 
Finally, you have a right to receive notice of our practices at or before collection of personal information and you have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of your rights described under this section.                        We will not discriminate against you based on your exercise of any of your rights.
 
 
 
You can assert these rights only where we receive a verified request from you. For information on how to exercise your rights, please see the 
Your Information and Rights
                section above.
 
Use of Agents.
 If you are a consumer in a jurisdiction that recognizes the ability to use an authorized agent and wish to contact us through an authorized agent, the authorized agent can submit a request on your                behalf to 
privacy@netflix.com
 along with a statement, certified as may be required, that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf. In order to verify the request, we may ask you to verify your                identity. For more information about how to access your information, including our verification process, please reference this help article: 
help.netflix.com/node/100624
. 
 
Appeals.
 If you are in a jurisdiction that recognizes your ability to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your attempt to assert a right under applicable US State Privacy Laws, you may file an appeal                of our decision refusing  your request to exercise your rights under this Privacy Notice. Requests to change our policies or practices are not grounds for appeal.  You may request an appeal of such decision by contacting us at 
privacyappeals@netflix.com
,                please provide the state that you are writing from, accompanied with documentation you may have regarding the matter you are appealing. If your jurisdiction allows you to file a complaint with the state’s Attorney General’s Office regarding                any concerns with the result of your appeal request, you may do so by using the following links as may be applicable to you. You may submit a complaint to the Attorney General’s Office by selecting the appropriate link: Virginia (

If you do not own a Netflix account, we may not be able to respond to requests to exercise rights under this Privacy Notice, including, for example, the right to know or delete personal information. Because we only collect limited information                about individuals without an account, we are unable to verify requests from non-account holders to the standard required by the US State Privacy Laws. 
 
Retention of Personal Information.
 We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the                purposes described in our Privacy Statement. Specifically, we retain information for our legitimate interests and essential business purposes, such as operating, maintaining and improving our services; complying with our legal obligations;                and exercising our legal rights and remedies, including enforcing our terms of use. Our retention of information is based on many factors such as your relationship with Netflix (for example, are you a Netflix current member); the nature                of the information; compliance with our legal obligations; defending or resolving actual or anticipated legal claims. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.                For information about deletion, removal and retention of information, please reference this help article:

Welcome!
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your personal information through our services. If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the “data controller” of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our 
Terms of Service
). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It’s important that you read this entire policy, but here’s a summary to get you started:
We care a lot about privacy
. We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission.
We don’t sell your personal information
. Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties.
We limit what information is required
. We require the information that enables us to create your account, provide and maintain our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our legal requirements. The rest is optional.
We care deeply about safety
. Our dedicated Trust & Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe. We also use certain information to help us identify violations of our Community Guidelines and prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services. 
We give you control
. We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord.
‍
‍
Discord is your place to find community
We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you’re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community.
Our “services” has the same meaning as defined in the 
Terms of Service
. They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media. If we build another product, our services include that too.
As explained in our 
Terms of Service
, we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time.
We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like 
Highlights Notifications
, identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our 
Terms of Service
 and 
Community Guidelines
. These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don’t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the “
How to control your privacy
” section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content.
We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties.
‍
The information we collect
We collect certain information when you use Discord. This includes information you provide to us, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources.
Information you provide to us
Account information
. When you create a Discord account, you can come up with a username and password, and provide a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). You’ll also need to provide your birthday. In some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information (like a verified phone number) to your account. You may also have the option to add your name or nicknames.
Content you create
. This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages or posts (including drafts), send voice messages, create custom emojis, create short recordings of GoLive activity, or upload and share files through the services. This also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers. We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance. We also don’t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time. We may build features that help users engage with voice and video content, like create or send short recordings.
Payment information
. If you buy any paid services through Discord, you may need to submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your full name and billing address. Our payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information. Depending on the processor, we may also receive and store certain billing information, including the last four digits of the credit card number associated with the transaction. If you sell something through Discord, you may be required to provide additional information to our payment processors, such as bank account information to facilitate payments and copies of government issued identification required to identify users in accordance with regulatory obligations. If we decide to process our own payments in the future, we would receive and process this information ourselves.
Information from actions you take
. We collect information about your use of Discord and your activities on the services. This includes the friends you add, the users, bots, and apps you engage with, the games you play on your device, the servers or other communities you join and participate in, your roles in servers, content moderation decisions you make, information about purchases or sales you make on or through Discord including what you purchased or sold, and other related actions. You can control whether we collect, use, and display this information as described in the “
How to control your privacy
” section below.
Information used to enable optional features
. Certain features, like contact syncing, may require that you provide additional information (or grant us access to such information) to make them work. This also includes third-party integrations you choose to enable and the data you authorize those third-party services to share with us. For example, when you link a music streaming account, we may collect information about that account such as the song you are listening to in order to display that information on your profile or as your status (if you have chosen to do so).
Other information you provide directly to us
. You may have the option to submit additional information as you use Discord. For example, you may choose to participate in our verified server program, which requires that you provide additional information about yourself or your company. Or, you may participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on the services, or submit information to our Discord Support teams.
Information we collect automatically
We also collect information automatically from you when you use Discord. This includes:
Information about your device
. We collect information about the device you are using to access the services. For example, this includes information like your IP address, operating system information, browser information, and information about your device settings, such as your microphone and/or camera. 
Information about your use of the apps or websites
. For example, we collect log and event information related to how and when you use our services (such as the pages, servers, and channels you visit, the activities you engage in, or the embedded content you interact with).
Other information that we collect automatically
. When you take certain actions on other sites, we may receive information about you. For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from.
We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. First-party cookies are placed by us (and our third-party service providers) and allow you to use the services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the services. You can control cookies as described in the “
How to control your privacy
” section below. The services use the following types of cookies:
Strictly Necessary Cookies
: These are required for services to function and to meet our legal obligations. If you try to use tools to disable these cookies, parts of the services may not work properly.
Functional Cookies
: These help us provide enhanced functionality on the services like remembering language preferences. Disabling these could affect some service functionality.
Performance Cookies
: These allow us or our third-party analytics providers to learn how you and others use and engage with the services so we can understand and improve them.
Information we receive from other sources
We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform.
‍
How we use your information
We use your information for the following purposes:
‍
To fulfill our contract with you
To provide you with the services
. We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app).
To meet our commitments to the Discord community
. We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and other policies. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful content. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates the Terms, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), to create systems and models that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct.
To contact you
. We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased.
To provide customer service
. We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues.
For our legitimate business interests
To protect our services
. We use information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them.
To report on our company’s performance
. We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues.
To personalize the product
. We use your information to personalize our services. This information powers our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities or content first), Highlights Notifications, and similar features, and it helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the “
How to control your privacy
” section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience.
To improve our services
. We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers.   Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes.
To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms
. We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future.
To contact you
. We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you’ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications.
To comply with our legal obligations
We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity.
‍
With your consent
‍We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information.
‍
To protect someone’s vital interests
We may collect or share personal data if we think someone’s life is in danger—for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation.
‍
How we disclose your information
When you tell us to
. When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so.
With our vendors
. We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord.
To comply with the law
. We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities.
In an emergency
. We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person.
To enforce our policies and rights
. We may disclose information if needed to enforce our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.
With our related companies
. We may provide information to 
our related companies
, including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets
. We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets.
Aggregated or de-identified information
. We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business to partners or the public.
‍
Data retention
We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in 
our data retention policy
.
‍
How we protect your information
We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by 
configuring two-factor authentication
.
‍
How to control your privacy
We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here’s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below.
‍
Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in
You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services. You can choose what messages to send or post, who to engage with (e.g., one or more particular users or a potentially unlimited group of users), what information to include in your profile, whether to connect any third party services to your Discord account, and more. For example, if you share content in certain spaces, such as servers listed in Server Discovery or with public invite links, your content may be accessed by anyone. 
‍
Customize your personal Discord settings
We offer a number of settings that allow you to tailor your experience within Discord. Some of these relate to specific features: for example, you can choose whether to display your current activity (like the game you are playing or the music you are listening to) in your status in your User Settings page (this is the gear icon next to your username).
You can also access other privacy-specific settings in your User Settings. For example, you can decide which types of direct messages are scanned for explicit content, who can add you as a friend, and more. This is also where you can limit certain types of processing of your information:
Limit our ability to use your data to improve our services
. We offer certain settings that allow you to limit the information we collect to help us understand how users use our services, what features or products they may want, or to otherwise help us improve our business. If you turn off these settings, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information as described in these settings.
Limit our ability to personalize Discord for you
. We offer certain settings that control whether and how we may personalize Discord for you, such as offering you relevant recommendations for in-app content and features. If these settings are disabled, we will stop collecting and using certain event and log information as described in these settings.
You can learn more about these settings 
in our Help Center
.
Disable or delete your account
You can disable or delete your account via the User Settings menu. Disabling your account stops the processing of new data, but allows you to reactivate your account without interruption to you. Deleting your account permanently deletes identifying information and anonymizes other data as described in 
our data retention policy
. You can learn more about how to delete your account in 
this Help Center article
 and how to disable your account in 
this Help Center article
.
Manage your content and servers
You may edit or delete specific pieces of information within the services:
You can edit or delete any message you have sent or content you have posted if you still have access to the space where you posted it.
You can edit or delete a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so.
You can edit or delete a channel from a Discord server if you have the permissions needed to do so.
Content may be retained by Discord for use as described elsewhere in this policy and in 
our data retention policy
. Also, in limited circumstances, we may have a legal obligation to retain certain information, even if you delete the information or your account.
Access your information
If you want to see what information we have collected about you, you can request a copy of your data in the Privacy & Safety section of your User Settings. You should receive your data packet within 30 days. Data is delivered in common digital formats including CSV, JSON, and any other file format you used when uploading attachments to the services. You can learn more about how to access your information 
in our Help Center
.
Manage cookies

International data transfers
We are based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.
When transferring data outside the EEA, we use 
standard contract clauses
 (Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's 
adequacy decisions
 about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer.
Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to 
JAMS
. Under certain conditions specified by the Data Privacy Framework principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries.
For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s 
Data Privacy Framework site

Services offered by third parties
We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add “bots” created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services.
These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our 
Developer Terms of Service
 and 
Developer Policy
). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don’t control them or what information they collect. It’s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general.

Reddit Privacy Policy


Effective July 31, 2023. Last Revised July 31, 2023.





      At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to be the masters of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why Reddit, Inc. (""Reddit,” ""we” or ""us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the ""Services"") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us.
    



      We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by default. If you want to just browse, you don't need an account. If you want to create an account to participate in a subreddit, we don't require you to give us your real name. We don't automatically track your precise location. You can share as much or as little about yourself as you want. You can create multiple accounts, update information as you see fit, or ask us to delete your information.
    



      Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our services, which are focused on allowing people to come together and form communities, the vast majority of which are public. If you have questions about how we use your data, you can always ask us for more information.
    








What Information We Collect






















Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you
                      provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:
                    












Account information








You don't need an account to use Reddit. If you create a Reddit account, your account will have a username, which you provide or which was automatically generated. Your username is public, and it doesn't have to be related to your real name. You may need to provide a password, depending on whether you register using an email address, using a Single Sign-On (SSO) feature (such as Apple or Google), or phone number. If your account does not have a password, we may send you an email or SMS for verification purposes.
                      
When you use Reddit, you may provide other optional information. We may ask you to select interests (e.g. history, nature, sports) to help create a home feed for you or to select communities (e.g. r/technology) to join. You may also provide other information, such as a bio, gender, age, location, or profile picture. This information is optional and may be removed at any time. We also store your user account preferences and settings. We may ask for such information prior to you creating a username or account to help improve your experience exploring Reddit.
                      














Content you submit








We collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, audio and videos you broadcast, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, audio, and videos.
                      














Actions you take








We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.
                      














Transactional information








If you purchase products or services from us (e.g., Reddit Premium or Reddit Coins), we will collect certain information from you, including your name, address, email address, phone number, and information about the product or service you are purchasing. Reddit may collect public blockchain addresses, such as when you purchase an NFT or when a Reddit Vault is created. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services (for example, Stripe) to handle payment information and does not store Reddit Vault private key information.
                      














Other information








You may choose to provide other information to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored programs, activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.
                      








































Information We Collect Automatically


When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:
                    












Log and usage data








We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.
                      














Information collected from cookies and similar technologies








We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to deliver and maintain our services and our site, improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertising, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. See our 
Cookie Notice
 for more information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see ""Your Choices” below.
                      


















Location information










We may receive and process information about your location. We may receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive an approximate location based on your IP address.
                      










































Information Collected from Other Sources
We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and combine it with data you have provided to Reddit, using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by visiting the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section titled ""Your Rights and Choices” below.
                      














Linked services








If you authorize or link a third-party service (e.g., an unofficial mobile app client) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. For example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see ""How Information About You Is Shared” below.
                      














Information collected from integrations








We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services, including our embeds and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a site that uses 
Reddit embeds
, we may receive information about the web page you visited. Similarly, if an advertiser incorporates Reddit's ad technology, Reddit may receive limited information about your activity on the advertiser's site or app, such as whether you bought something from the advertiser. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in ""Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics” below.
                      






































Information Collected by Third Parties












Embedded content








Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Reddit services via ""embeds.” For example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or Twitter may load the linked video or tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don't have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is embedded.
                      














Audience measurement








We partner with service providers that perform audience measurement to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit. To provide this demographic information, these companies collect cookie information to recognize your device.
                      










































Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers


If you use Reddit Ads (Reddit's self-serve ads platform at ads.reddit.com) we collect some additional information. To sign up for Reddit Ads, you must provide your name, email address, and information about your company. If you purchase advertising services, you will need to provide transactional information as described above, and we may also require additional documentation to verify your identity. When using Reddit Ads, we may record a session replay of your visit for customer service, troubleshooting, and usability research purposes.
                      




















How We Use Information


We use information about you to:




Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;


Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and settings.


Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the 
Reddit User Agreement
 and our other policies;


Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services; 


Research and develop new services;


Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages;


Provide customer service;


Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of these communications, see ""Your Choices” below); and


Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services.




How We Share Information



        Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.
      



        When you submit content (including a post, comment, or chat message) to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Reddit allows other sites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and other similar technologies. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator's option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.
      



        Your Reddit account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, awards received, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Premium status, and how long you have been a member of the Services. You can also choose for your profile to include the content you upvote and downvote.
      



        We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., 
Tumblr
, 
Facebook
, and 
Twitter
).
        





        We do not sell your personal information. However, in addition to the personal information that is displayed publicly as described above, we may share personal information in the following ways: .
      






With your consent.
 We may share information about you with your consent or at
          your direction.
        




With linked services.
 If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in ""Your Rights and Choices"" below.
        




With our service providers.
 We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. Their use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. A few examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services.
        




To comply with the law.
 We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our 
Transparency Report
 has additional information about how we respond to government requests.
        




In an emergency.
 We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
        




To enforce our policies and rights.
 We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our
          
User Agreement
,
          
rules
, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.
        




With our affiliates.
 We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
        




Aggregated or de-identified information.
 We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many people saw their ad.
          












How We Protect Your Information





        We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.
      



        You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring
        
two-factor authentication
.
      



        We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.
        










Your Rights and Choices





        You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also have the right to request access to or ability to port, deletion/erasure of, or correction/rectification of, your personal information, to opt out of certain advertising practices, or to withdraw consent for processing where you have previously provided consent. Below we explain how to exercise each of these rights. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.
      


















Accessing and Changing Your Information






You can access your information and change or correct certain information through the Services. See
                      our 
Help Center
 page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described 
here
.
                      












Deleting Your Account






You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. You can also submit a request to delete the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described below this table. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. After you submit a request to delete your account, it may take up to 90 days for our purge script to complete deletion. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
                      












Controlling Linked Services' Access to Your Account






You can review the services you have permitted to access your account and revoke access to individual services by visiting your account's 
Apps page
 (for third-party app authorizations) and the Connected Accounts section of your 
Account Settings
 (for Google Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, and connected Twitter accounts).
                      












Opt Out of Targeted Advertising






You may opt out of us using information we collect from third parties, including advertising partners, to personalize the ads you see on Reddit. To do so, visit the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings in your account 
here
, if using desktop, and in your Account Settings if using the Reddit mobile app.
                      












Controlling the Use of Cookies






Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. For more information on controlling how cookies and similar technologies are used on Reddit, see our 
Cookie Notice
.
                      














Controlling Advertising and Analytics






Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by 
Google Analytics
 via the 
Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on
. You can opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by 
Nielsen
 and 
Quantcast
.
                      

                      You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the sites of the 
Digital Advertising Alliance
 and the 
Network Advertising Initiative

Do Not Track






Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.
                      












Controlling Promotional Communications






You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences 
here
. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.
                      












Controlling Mobile Notifications






With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.

California Privacy Statement






 








California Residents: Please see our California Privacy Statement and Notice at Collection 
here
. 
















 






Summary of changes






 








We work hard to make our use of personal data transparent and to make your rights and choices easy to understand.  Privacy laws have continued to evolve and we made changes to this policy based on new privacy laws in some U.S. states.  We also added new information for our EEA and UK residents about the data controller of their personal data.
















 






Thank you for using Pinterest!






 








Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. To do that, we show you personalized content and ads we think you’ll be interested in based on information we collect from you and other parties. 


We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it. Some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.

 
















 






Scope of the Privacy Policy






 








This is Pinterest’s global Privacy Policy. We have highlighted below where a particular section applies to you based on where you live. 


For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (“
GDPR
”), if you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland, and UK, Pinterest Europe Ltd. and Pinterest, Inc. are joint data controllers of your personal data. Pinterest Europe Ltd. is an Irish company with its registered office at Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  Pinterest, Inc. is a US company with its registered office at 651 Brannan St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. Pinterest Europe Ltd is the responsible controller for fulfilling key obligations under the GDPR.  If you have any questions about our data processing activities, please contact our 
Data Protection Officer
.
















 






We collect information in a few different ways






 




1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it








When you use Pinterest websites, apps, services, technologies, APIs, widgets, or any other 
products
 or features we offer (“Pinterest” or the “Services”), you voluntarily share certain information.


Account Information
: When you join our Services, we collect information like your name, email address, birthday, gender, and preferred language. If you have a business account, depending on where you live, you may also have the option to add race and ethnicity information to your profile.
Content
: We collect information when you save or upload Pins, photos, or other content, interact with Pins or other content (for example, commenting or adding a Pin), or where you send messages and interact with other users. 
Precise location information
: Depending on where you live, you can choose to share your precise location using your device settings. 
Your communications with us
: If you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, we collect the content of these communications. 
Your contacts
: If you previously chose to sync your contacts with your account, we will continue to process certain information about your contacts who are Pinterest users to help you find one another on our Services.








 




2. We also get technical information when you use Pinterest








When you use a website, mobile application or other internet service, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically. This is also true when you use Pinterest. Here are some of the types of information we collect:


Device information
: We collect information about the device you use to access our Services, including the type of device, operating system, network service provider, settings, and unique device identifiers.
Log data
: When you use our Services, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, activity on websites you visit that incorporate Pinterest features (like the “Save” button) browser type and settings, and the date and time of when you accessed the Services. You can 
learn more about the log data we collect here
.
Information from cookies and similar technologies
: We also use “cookies” or similar technologies to obtain log data. For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. For more information about how we use cookies, please review our 
Cookie Policy
.
Usage data and inferences
. When you’re on our Services, we use your activity—such as which Pins you click on, terms you search for, boards you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description—along with other information you’ve provided when you first signed up and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences. For example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer you are a travel enthusiast. We may also infer other information, such as your education or professional experience. 
Location Information
: We use your IP address to infer your approximate location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location, and photos you share may include information about the location where they were taken.
User Choices
: We will keep a record of choices you’ve selected in your settings, including privacy settings and whether you have enabled notifications.








 




3. Our partners and advertisers share information with us








We also receive information about you and your activity outside Pinterest from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with. For example:


Third party platforms
: If you register for or log into the Service using a third party platform, they will furnish certain information to us to facilitate your account creation or log-in with us. In addition, if you 
connect your third-party accounts
 to our Services, we may use information from those accounts to improve your experience. Further, some third-party applications use Pinterest features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps, including usage data. 
Technical service partners
: We sometimes receive information about you from technical service partners, including from marketing firms.
Advertisers or other partners
: Online advertisers or third parties share information with us about you to measure, report on or improve the performance of ads on Pinterest, or to help us better understand what kinds of ads to show you on Pinterest. For example, we may receive  information about your visits to an advertiser's site, or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads on the Service. Sometimes we get this information through the Pinterest Tag (a piece of code an advertiser puts on their site), which delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on our Services. 
Learn more about the Pinterest Tag
 and the types of information advertisers or other third parties share with us. 
You can control how we use this information to personalize your experience and the ads you see on Pinterest in your 
Privacy and Data Settings
. 

 
















 






How we use the info we collect






 








We’re committed to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. To do that, we use your information to provide and improve your experience, including to:


Identify you when you use our Services.
Recommend Pins, boards, or content you might like based on your activity on our Services and your offsite behavior. For example, if we see you’re into cooking-related content on Pinterest, we may suggest food-related Pins to you. Similarly, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar Pins to you. For more information on how we recommend content to you, please visit our 
Terms of Service
. 
Respond to your questions or comments.
Build your community on our Services. We use your info to suggest other people who have similar interests. For example, if you follow interior design boards, we may suggest interior designers that you might like. We also use data to help your friends and contacts find you on Pinterest. For example, people can search for your account on Pinterest using your email. If you previously chose to sync your contacts with your Pinterest account, we will process certain information about your contacts who are Pinterest users to help you find them on our Services.
Allow searching with photos, if you choose. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.
Depending on where you live, and with your consent, identify your precise location and customize your experience on our Services. For example, if we know that you’re near a retailer we may show you that retailer’s Pins that may be of interest to you. You can opt in to (and out of) this in your device operating system settings.
Send you updates, including by email, push notification, SMS, or phone. You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails at any time and decide to 
stop getting other notifications
 by updating your 
settings
.








 








We use your information in our efforts to improve our Services, keep our users and the public safe, and to protect legal interests. To do so, we:


Review your activity and messages on our Services to detect spam or activity that poses a risk to our community or the public. This can include working with law enforcement to keep Pinterest safe.
Analyze users’ log data and device information to identify and investigate suspicious behavior or violations of our policies or Terms.
May access user information in relation to a legal claim, litigation, or regulatory proceeding. 
Conduct analytics and research on who is using our Services and what they are doing. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Pinterest, we can understand which version is better.
Improve the products and services of our family of companies and offer new features. 
Create aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. Pinterest processes, maintains, and uses this information only in a de-identified fashion for the purposes of this Privacy Policy and will not attempt to re-identify such information.








 








We also use your information to personalize the ads you see


Specifically, we use the information we collect to:


Decide which ads to show you. For example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Pinterest or browse sleeping bags on one of our partner’s websites, we may show you ads for other outdoor products. We customize the ad content we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties. Where we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we’ll get your consent where required. 
Advertise Pinterest products and services to you on other sites and apps. To do this, we disclose information such as cookie IDs, your IP address, or a hashed version of your email address to third parties, such as Facebook Ads, Google Marketing Platform, and others who may combine that information with other information they already have about you and deliver ads about Pinterest to you. 
Learn more
 about our marketing practices off Pinterest and how to opt-out.
Tell our ad partners how their Pinterest ads are doing, and how to make them better. To do this, we disclose information about the ads you see or interact with on Pinterest to our advertisers and third-party companies to improve the performance of the ads that we or they use to audit or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps. Some of this information is aggregated. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Pin went on to visit that advertiser's site. Depending on where you live and your settings, we may also disclose this information at an individual level. For example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular Pin has been saved by certain people. To find out more about reporting on ads please 
visit the Help Center
.
Some of these activities may be considered “targeted advertising” “sharing” or “selling” as those terms are defined under certain state privacy laws in the US. You can opt out of Pinterest using and disclosing your information for these purposes. To do so, visit your 
Privacy and Data Settings
. 


When we use cookies to learn about your behavior on or off of our services, we or our partners will obtain consent that we may need under applicable law. To find out more about how we use cookies, please see our 
Cookie Policy
.

Why and how we use your info


To comply with legal and regulatory obligations




Accessing, storing, preserving, or sharing information when doing so in response to a court order, search warrant, production order, subpoena or similar legal request. 


Accessing, storing, preserving, or sharing information when we think it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including sharing with law enforcement or other authorities. 


To deal with and resolve requests and complaints. We retain correspondence relating to data subject requests under GDPR for two years, in case those requests are not resolved and this correspondence is required in order to handle any resulting complaints. In such cases, the correspondence is then retained while those complaints are being resolved.




Examples of laws that can require us to process information in the above way include:




Regulatory matters: to comply with regulatory obligations like under privacy laws (GDPR).


Civil, commercial, criminal, or consumer protection matters: where we are in receipt of a court order to disclose information for the purposes of court proceedings or regulatory inquiries (e.g. orders or mandatory requests under the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, GDPR).


Corporate and taxation matters: obligations such as the Irish Companies Act 2014 and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.




Issues relating to the safety of our Service and to protect rights, property and users




We keep information where it is necessary to investigate misuse of our Services, such as spam and other bad experiences. If we disable an account for violating our Terms, we also preserve information about that user for safety, security and integrity purposes.




Information categories used


Any of the categories of information listed in “
We Collect Information in a few different ways
” except for Precise location information (which we don’t collect from users in EEA, Switzerland, or the UK).








 
How and why we use your info


Where you have given us consent (for example through your device settings):




Allowing searching with photos. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.


Ads on Pinterest based on offsite activities. We customize the ad content we show you by identifying your interests based on your offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties. Where ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they have already obtained.


Lead ads. If you submit information via a lead ad form (for example, to sign up for an advertiser’s mailing list or for a consultation), we will share that information with the advertiser as described on the form.


Promotion of Creators. If you choose to provide race or ethnicity information we will use it to promote you as a Creator, for example during Black History Month, or reach out to you about events.




Information categories used


Any of the categories of information listed in “
We Collect Information in a few different ways
” except for Precise location information (which we don’t collect from users in EEA, Switzerland, or the UK).












 








Where we rely on consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time.

You may opt out at any time by following the instructions in your Privacy and Data Settings menu. Note that you will still see ads on our Services, but they will not be informed by offsite data.








 






 
If you live in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, you also have some additional rights: 




Right to object or restrict processing
: You can object to direct marketing from us or where we rely on legitimate interests to process your information. You can object through this

Forms for Data Protection
.


















 








We will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise your rights or options related to your personal information. These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interest to keep.

You have choices regarding your information on Pinterest. If you have a Pinterest account, many of these controls are built directly into Pinterest or your settings. For example, you can: 
Edit information in your profile
, 
Link or unlink your Pinterest account
 from other services (like Facebook or Google), 
Edit secret board settings
, and 
Close your account at any time
. We also support settings such as Limit Ad Tracking in iOS and Ads Personalization in Android devices.

The browser you use may let you control cookies or other types of local data storage.
Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your precise location, photos, and other data is shared with us.

	 














 






How and when we share information






 








Anyone can see the public content you post, such as boards and Pins you create and public profile information you give us. Depending on where you live, we also make this public information available through what are called APIs (a technical way to share information quickly). For example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API. We also share the categories of information described above:


With other services, at your direction. For example, when you decide to 
link your Pinterest account
 to third party services, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to such services, you direct disclosure of certain information to those services. Creators may direct us to share information with advertisers or other partners for paid engagements.
We share data for advertising and related purposes, including showing you ads about Pinterest on third-party services and helping advertisers understand how ads on Pinterest perform.  When you fill out a lead ad form, we’ll share this information with the advertiser as described in the form.
With vendors that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by vendors on our behalf.
With law enforcement agencies, government agencies, or other parties in compliance with the law. For example, we may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts. We only disclose information in response to such requests if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. To find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our 
Law Enforcement Guidelines
.
With our corporate family of companies, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).














 






Transferring your information






 








Pinterest is a worldwide service. By using our products or services, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in such countries may not be equivalent to those of your home country.










 






 
If you live in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take additional steps related to data transfers. Information controlled by Pinterest Europe Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. Please note these data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in our Terms and to operate globally.  


Because Pinterest is a worldwide service, we may transfer the personal data of EEA, Switzerland, and UK residents to a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK. Where we transfer information from the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK to a country that doesn't provide an adequate level of protection, we’ll only do so under appropriate safeguards to protect your information.


Safeguards which we rely on in ensuring your information benefits from an adequate level of protection includes the following:  




Adequacy decisions. These are decisions issued from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “
How we use the info we collect
” to some countries with such adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed 
here
; or 


Standard contractual clauses (“
SCCs
”). The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “
How we use the info we collect
” to certain entities in our family of companies and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision. 


While transfers to countries that don’t have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of SCCs, in certain circumstances, transfers can also take place on the basis of exemptions provided under data protection law. For example, sharing with law enforcement, in emergency situations where we learn that a person’s life is at risk. 




We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:




technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation; and 


policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests.




For a copy of these adequacy decisions or SCCs, please contact us via the details provided in the 
Contact us
 section below.

 


















 






How long we keep your information






 








We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Pinterest to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't use it to identify you.


If you live in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, here is some further information on our retention practices: We keep your information only so long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, which include providing our Service, or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, or protecting or defending our rights, property and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis. We keep account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account.

 
















 






Our policy on children's information






 








Children under 13 are not allowed to use Pinterest. If you are based in a state or country with an older age requirement, you may only use the Services if you are at or over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing. Please visit the 
Help Center
 for more information.
















 






How we make changes to this policy






 








We may change this policy from time to time and if we do, we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Pinterest after those changes are in effect, the new policy applies to you. If the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice, such as by sending you an email.

 
















 






Contact us






 








The best way to get in touch with us or to exercise your options described above is through the 
Help Center
. If you live in the United States, Pinterest, Inc. is responsible for your information. You can contact Pinterest Inc. at 651 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.


You can also contact our 
Data Protection Officer

Performing services, including maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytics services, providing storage, or providing similar services
Performing and providing advertising and marketing services, including targeted advertising
To conduct auditing and monitoring of transactions and engagement, including auditing related to counting ad impressions to unique visitors, verifying positioning and quality of ad impressions, and auditing compliance
Short-term, transient use, such as non-personalized advertising shown as part of your current interaction with us
Helping to ensure security and integrity and prevent fraud

Fulfilling our legal functions or obligations
To the extent we process deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information unless permitted by applicable law.








How Do We Collect Personal Information?








We may obtain and combine personal information from different sources, collected online and offline, including information from third-party sources across different types of technology and devices.
Provided Directly by You or a Member of Your Household
When you visit us in our stores or online, you may share different types of personal information with us when you engage in the activities below:
Conduct a transaction in-store or online, or request a service where we collect information (including when required by law, such as alcohol sales or hunting and fishing licenses)
Create an account on one of our websites or mobile services
Use a gift registry or create a mobile shopping list
Participate in our programs, such as Walmart Pay or Walmart+
Request customer service or contact us
Interact with various types of technologies, applications and features, including our chatbot
Post a rating, review or other user-generated content on one of our websites or mobile services, or post a review or comment on one of our social media pages
Participate in a contest, sweepstake, promotion, or survey
Use features of our websites or mobile services that enable us, with your consent, to access the camera, microphone, or contacts on your computer or mobile device to provide you with functionality, such as voice search, scanning bar codes for online search or mobile scan & go, or importing your mobile contacts. You must give us your permission before we access these features, and you can opt out of providing access to them at any time by adjusting the settings on your device.
In addition to the above, we may use your device’s camera to provide virtual services such as eyeglass virtual try-on services and pupillary measurements. To use this feature, either you are at least the legal age of the jurisdiction (e.g., state) in which you reside or you have obtained parental or guardian consent. You (or your parents/guardians) are given the option to consent to the collection and use of your biometric information as described here, or decline use of the service, before we use your device’s camera for this service. If you use this service, your device’s camera (e.g., Apple’s TrueDepth camera) uses facial scanning technology to measure your unique features so we can virtually place eyeglass frames over the image of your face. To do this, we collect your biometric information and disclose it to our authorized service provider for processing. Any biometric data we collect from you will be deleted within 48 hours and will be used solely for the purpose of enabling you to see yourself wearing virtual eyeglass frames.
If you use the Walmart shopping voice assistant within the Walmart app, and consent to microphone and speech recognition, Walmart will have access to your microphone when the Walmart app is open and will continually listen for the key words “Hey, Walmart” to wake up your assistant. Walmart does not retain any information prior to recognizing the “Hey, Walmart” utterance, and only uses information collected after hearing that utterance for limited purposes such as providing the service, maintaining the quality or safety of the service, or fulfilling other internal business purposes, or our legal or compliance obligations.
Collected Through Automated Means
We may obtain personal information about you such as device and online identifiers and internet or other network activity information via automated means through your use of technology, such as when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications or services, or click on advertisements or links in emails you receive from us.
Also, depending on your device’s settings, we may collect precise geolocation information. You can control our ability to do this by adjusting the location-sharing settings on your mobile device at any time. You also may adjust your mobile device’s Bluetooth settings to disable the sharing of Bluetooth location-related data.
Your mobile device’s GPS signal allows us to show you the Walmart stores closest to you. It also lets us know when you are about to arrive to pick up your Online Grocery Pickup order after you check in.
We may be able to recognize the location of your mobile device in our stores when you are in a store where we provide free WiFi access or through the use of Bluetooth technology. Through mobile services, Bluetooth technology in our stores allows us to show you nearby products that may interest you, making it easier for you to locate products within, and navigate through, the store. 
Collected Through In-Store Technology
We may collect your personal information from technology we use in our stores. For example, our point-of-sale terminals process your credit card information when you complete your purchase, and we operate in-store cameras for security and operational purposes, such as to help deter theft or improve store design to better serve our customers.
Obtained from Other Companies within Our Corporate Family
We may obtain your personal information from another company within our corporate family, such as Sam's Club.
Obtained from External Third-Party Sources
We may obtain personal information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our services, increase the appeal and relevance of advertising, and to prevent or detect fraud. We also may obtain device and browsing information, from third parties for marketing purposes.
Collected from Another Solution or Asset
For example,
 
when you speak to customer service, we collect your personal information using call recording technology in accordance with applicable law.








Who Do We Disclose to & Why?








We may share the categories of personal information described above with certain categories of third parties, as described below.
Within Our Corporate Family of Companies

How Can You Set Your Preferences?








Marketing
For marketing communications, we use an:
Opt-in standard
 for automated phone and text messages, and for disclosing personal information with companies outside of our corporate family of companies to promote their products and services through direct marketing. Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your consent. 
Opt-out standard
 for email, mobile service (in-app) notifications, and postal mail.
You may withdraw your consent if you would like to stop receiving marketing communications. Please communicate your marketing communications requests directly to us or through a third party authorized to act on your behalf by:
Visiting the 
Communication Preferences & Alerts
 page to adjust your preferences for marketing communications.
Using the 
Contact Us
 section below, providing the types of communications you would like to receive or not receive, and your contact information.
For email requests, it may take up to ten days for us to process your requests. For requests related to telephone calls, text messages, mobile service notifications, and disclosing information with your consent, it may take up to 30 days. If you adjust your postal mail preferences, it may take six to ten weeks before you stop receiving mail because postal mailings are prepared many weeks in advance.
Regardless of your marketing communication preferences, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes, such as customer service, reminder or service notices, recalls, or information regarding your orders.
Additionally, the consent standards described in this section do not apply to Walmart co-branded credit card offerings provided through associated financial institutions.

Opting out only applies to your current web browser on your current computer. If you use multiple computers or multiple web browsers, you must opt out on each one.

“Privacy Choices”: Do Not Sell or Share or Process My Personal Information for Targeted Advertising (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia Residents only)


 




California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  Such residents may also opt out of the sharing or processing of their personal information for targeted advertising.



We provide third parties such as advertisers and advertising networks (including social media networks) information including identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; hashed identifiers [contact information], geolocation information, such as city; and inference data in order to enable marketing to you and delivery of targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites.  Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables NBCUniversal to provide you certain content for free and provide relevant offers to you.  The disclosure of such personal information listed above to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under applicable law and is sharing of personal information and the processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.








If you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of NBCUniversal’s use or disclosure of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so in the footer or settings menu of the brand with which you engage by selecting “Your Privacy Choices” link.


You may still receive advertising, including personalized ads based on NBCUniversal data on the Services. On some of our websites and applications when you click the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the website footer or in the application settings menu, you will be shown a tool that allows you to opt out of the online “sales” and sharing/processing of personal information for targeted ads on the website and application.  Please note, if you use different browsers, devices, or services you will need to make your elections separately. In some cases, you may also be presented with form field to complete, in those cases we ask for your email address or other information so we may add it to an appropriate suppression list. In other cases, you will be directed to this page where we provide additional information and options for you to learn more about your choices and how to opt out from interest-based advertising more broadly.


Please note, if we do not detect that you are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia, the opt out of sale or sharing/processing for targeted advertising data choices will not apply even if you take the actions described above.  


Please note that if you have a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent required by applicable law.

 


Sensitive Data


We may use certain sensitive personal information as allowable by law for purposes including analytics and to enable marketing to you and the delivery of targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites, such displaying an ad relevant to your precise location data.  


 




You can change your precise geolocation permissions for our mobile apps in your mobile device settings.




 


Incentive Programs (California Residents Only)


The Services may offer opportunities to receive certain services or benefits such as discounts or free or extended services (such as bonus streaming time or additional videos), which may require the provision of personal information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable law (each, an “Incentive Program”).
  
When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program (e.g., by opting out of emails or terminating a streaming service). To the extent we can determine the value of your information, we consider the value of providing you with a more personalized experience as well as the expenses we incur in providing Incentive Programs that are reasonably related to the costs associated with offering the Incentives.


 




Third Parties List – Shine the Light (California Residents only)


California residents can also request a list of all the third parties to which we have disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California’s Shine the Light law) during the preceding year for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

Third-Party Online Services


NBCUniversal Services may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) of third party platforms or contain links to third party services. These other platforms (such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, and set top boxes) and sites (even if co-branded as NBCUniversal) may collect information about you and use this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms of service.

HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION














We maintain organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect the information we collect and use. These safeguards vary depending upon a variety of factors including the sensitivity of the information we collect and use. Despite all reasonable practices, no security method is infallible.






HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION














We will keep your information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests.  The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes.  If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.


We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. The retention period that applies to your information may vary depending on the NBCUniversal Services you use and how you interact with them. Some NBCUniversal Services may provide additional details on their data retention practices, so we encourage you to consult their website and/or FAQs. In addition, in the event you have an account that holds credits, point balances or other entitlements, we may continue to hold the account to allow you to obtain the benefit in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions.

We may transfer your information to Related Companies, service providers, and other third parties located outside of your country of residence, including in the United States. This is necessary to provide our Services and for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.  Data privacy laws vary from country to country and may not be equivalent to, or as protective as, the laws in your home country.  We take steps to ensure that reasonable safeguards are in place with aim to ensure an appropriate level of protection for your information, in accordance with applicable law. These measures include data transfer agreements. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use.






UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY














We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes to our practices or the law. We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the NBCUniversal Services.  Please check the NBCUniversal Services periodically for updates.


The date at the top of the Privacy Policy tells you when it was last updated.

Intuit Global Privacy Statement
Last Updated: September 6, 2023

Collapse All
Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role
Intuit responsibly leverages technology to power prosperity around the world. We believe that everyone has a right to privacy. As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (
“Privacy Statement”
) to explain how we, Intuit Inc. and the 
Intuit group companies
 (collectively 
“Intuit,” “we,” “us,” or “our”
), collect, use, share, or otherwise process information that we collect through our services. These services include, as applicable, our websites, mobile applications, social media pages, marketing activities, and other activities described in this Privacy Statement, or when other businesses provide us your personal information (collectively, the 
“Services”
). This Privacy Statement is global, meaning it applies to all Intuit Services. We may provide additional or supplemental privacy statements for certain products or services.
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices when we process:
Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “
Tax Preparation Information
”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;
Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of our websites and the Intuit platform, which includes all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) other than Tax Preparation Information (the “
Intuit Platform
”); and
Personal information as necessary to manage, run, improve, and develop our business and personalize your experience while interacting with the Intuit Platform. Depending on your settings, this may include showing you personalized ads or recommending certain Intuit products based on your interests.
Intuit determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement, and therefore acts as a ‘data controller’ (or equivalent/similar terms under applicable data privacy laws) of such information. We may share your personal information within the 
Intuit group companies
 a
nd conduct processing activities as controllers or joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
In certain circumstances, there may be more than one data controller processing your personal information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as a data controller. In these situations, we act as an independent data controller over our processing activities. This means we determine how your personal information will be processed independently from the other data controllers. The other data controllers have their own obligations under applicable data privacy laws. Intuit is not responsible for other data controllers’ processing activities, and you should contact them directly for questions about how they process your personal information and about how to exercise your privacy rights in relation to such processing.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to certain processing activities where we are not the controller.  For example, where Intuit processes personal information as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, including when we process personal information on behalf of customers of our professional tax software products. When we act as a processor or service provider, the privacy statement of the customer who uses our Services applies, instead of this Privacy Statement, and our processing of such personal information is governed by our agreements with such customers. If you have concerns about personal information that we process on behalf of a customer, or wish to exercise your privacy rights regarding such personal information, please contact the customer directly. 
This Privacy Statement also does not apply to Intuit Financial Services or Intuit’s processing of education records subject to state or federal laws or children’s data in our education curriculum products.  You may find the privacy statement for Intuit Financial Services 
here
. 
If you have any questions about how Intuit processes your personal information, please see How to contact us below.
The Intuit platform
The Intuit Platform and your personal information
When we say “platform,” we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), Intuit uses that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you’re using. This means that, for example, we may use your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, budgets from Mint, contact and purchase history details from Mailchimp, and/or recommendations from Credit Karma. The personal information we use in this centralized way may relate to you as an end user of our Services or as a customer or vendor of an Intuit customer whose personal information has been included in the Intuit Platform.
Business account information
Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with a business (such as your employer). If you are granted access to a business account (for example, in QuickBooks), the business owner or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights; making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll); or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift). If the owner or designated administrator changes your access rights, then you may lose access to the information the business controls.
Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of a business account may be subject to the business’s policies, which may differ from this Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other businesses, and you should consider both the business’s policies and whether you are comfortable giving the business access to your personal information before connecting to their services.
Personal information we collect
The personal information that we collect or otherwise receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account, and the choices you make, including your privacy settings. The way we process your personal information may also depend on the particular Services, functionalities, or experiences you use, your location, and applicable law.
Information you provide to us
You may provide us with your information as follows:
Contact data and account profile data.
 We collect information when you (or your organization) create an account, activate a subscription, and/or upload information to the Intuit Platform. Personal information may include your name, previous name(s) and/or nicknames, title and honorifics, professional title and company name, education, billing and mailing addresses, phone number and email address, profile photo, billing information (your payment information), purchase history, demographic information, preferences, subscription data, and your username and account credentials.
Identity verification information.
 We collect information to verify your identity, including your name, date of birth, social security number, social insurance number, driver’s license number, passport number, government-issued identification details, and similar information to verify your identity and to help you file your tax return.
Communications, feedback and survey data, and related data. 
We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number and any other personal information you choose to share when you reach out to us for support, give us feedback, participate in optional surveys, attend our events, participate in product research or training, or otherwise interact or communicate with us. This information may include: call center recordings and call monitoring records, chat and text records, voicemails, photographs, and video images.
Marketing data.
 You may provide us with your contact information and preferences for receiving marketing communications.
Social and community content.
 We receive content you post on our social media pages and our community pages.
Business and financial information.
 We may receive information about your business, your finances, expenses, invoices, financial statements, details of your financial transactions, payroll details, payment details, tax return details, details about your customers, vendors, or employees, income and wage information, and/or investment information.
Interactions with experts.
 The Intuit Platform provides many opportunities for you to connect with live experts, including, for example, accountants or tax preparers. When you interact with these experts, we may receive information about the questions you ask, the details of your accounts, and the guidance provided to you.
Interactions with chatbots.
 We may receive information from you through your use of chatbots, digital assistants, or other interactive bots across the Intuit Platform.
Device and contact data.
 If you grant permission in your device settings, certain features may have access to your device and contacts.
Third-party sources
The Intuit Platform is designed to help you connect with other people and businesses. As a result of those connections, others may be able to input personal information about you, including other customers using the Intuit Platform. For example, an Intuit customer may share personal information about you with us in order to use and benefit from the Intuit Platform. You also may be able to input or process personal information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator of one of our products or use Intuit to manage customer lists. If you input information about others into the Platform, you must only do so if you have first provided sufficient notice and received any required permissions, and have an appropriate legal basis if required by applicable law.
We may also receive personal information about you from other third parties where you have provided consent or where permitted by applicable law. We protect and process the personal information obtained from those third parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. Our third-party sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the Intuit Platform. For example, we receive information from:
Linked third-party services.
 If you choose to sync a non-Intuit account/service with your Intuit account, we will receive information from that account/service according to your settings with that account/service. This may include details of your bank account information, social media information, purchase history or your business’s sales records through a point of sale application.  
Supplemental information and identity verification providers.
 We work with certain third parties to help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business, and/or supplement the personal information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your personal information. For example, we use third-party providers to validate your contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address, phone number) or to provide additional details about your business. These providers may include, for example, your financial institution, telecommunications provider, or email provider.
Customer support providers.
 We receive personal information about you or your interaction with the Intuit Platform from certain third parties for troubleshooting purposes. For example, we may obtain information about your interaction(s) with customer support and information about technical issues you have raised, including call center recordings, call monitoring records, voicemails, photographs and chat records.
Credit bureaus and related third parties.
 Many Intuit features rely on information we receive from credit bureaus and related third parties. For example, in some countries, we may offer free credit reports and credit scores. We request these reports and credit scores on your behalf from credit bureau partners, like TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. These partners may also provide personal information such as employment or income data, social security number, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so we can make more personalized recommendations for you. 
Other users.
 As described above, we may receive personal information about you from other Intuit Platform users, such as your accountant, bookkeeper, tax preparer, spouse, employer, or other business customers using the Intuit Platform (e.g., businesses from which you buy products or services, or with which you otherwise interact). We may also collect such personal information through features like member referral programs.
Risk management, cybersecurity & anti-fraud providers.
 We may receive personal information from third parties that help us assess risks associated with our offerings, including to help combat fraud and illegal activity and to help protect your personal information.
Data providers.
 We may receive information from information services and data licensors that provide demographic and preference information to us.
Content providers.
 We may receive personal information from companies that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.
Joint offering partners.
 We may offer co-branded services or experiences or engage in joint-marketing activities with others, including through our conferences or live events.
Government agencies.
 We receive information from government agencies, including from various tax agencies, such as your tax filing confirmation from the IRS. 
Public information.
 We collect individual and household demographic information and preference information from publicly available sources, such as open government databases, social media platforms, and others.
Automatic data collection
We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log personal information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Services, such as:
Device information.
 We may collect information about your device(s) such as IP addresses, log information, error messages, device type, and unique device identifiers. For example, we may collect IP addresses from you as part of our sign in and security features. 
Usage information.
 We may collect information about your use of the Intuit Platform, such as the pages you viewed, the services and features you used or interacted with, your browser type, and details about any links or communications with which you interacted.
Location information.
 Certain features in the Intuit Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion information, or both, if you or your organization grant(s) us permission to do so through your device settings (for example, if you use QuickBooks’ time-tracking service, participate in Karma Drive, or use CK Money to locate nearby ATMs).
Information stored locally.
 Some of our web-enabled desktop services and offerings synchronize with the information on your computer. In doing so, we may collect information such as device information, product usage, and error reports. We may also store personal information locally on your device.
Communication interaction data.
 We or our third-party service providers may collect information from email providers, communication providers and social networks, such as your interactions with our email, text or other communications (e.g., whether you open and/or forward emails) – we may do this through use of pixel tags (which are also known as clear GIFs), which may be embedded invisibly in our emails.

Your Rights 
Depending on where you live, you may also have certain state- or country-specific rights with respect to your personal information. Please see the Region and state-specific terms section for your country, below.
Verification
To help protect privacy and the security of your personal information, you may be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity and/or ownership rights before we can fulfill your data rights request. If we cannot verify your identity or your ownership rights to the data, we may not be able to service your request until you provide proper documentation.
Data retention
Unless you specifically ask us to delete your personal information, we retain your personal information as long as it is necessary to comply with our data retention requirements and provide you with services and the benefits of the Intuit Platform and successfully run our business. Even if you submit a deletion request, we may be required to maintain your personal information for as long as necessary to:
comply with our legal or regulatory compliance needs (e.g., maintaining records of transactions you have made with us);
to exercise, establish or defend legal claims; and/or
to protect against fraudulent or abusive activity on our service.
This means we may keep different information for different periods. If your account is canceled because you haven’t used it for a long time, we may delete this information immediately.
There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize, or de-identify your personal information due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance, or other operational reasons. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to securely isolate your personal information from any further processing until such time as we are able to delete, anonymize, or de-identify it.
International data transfers
Unless you have provided us with consent to transfer your personal information, US Tax Preparation Information shall be processed and stored in the United States in accordance with applicable law.
With the exception noted above, Intuit reserves the right to store and process your personal information in the United States and in any other country where Intuit or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities in accordance with and as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
When we transfer, store or process personal information outside of your jurisdiction (including to or in the United States, as described above), we take appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law.
Some of these recipients of your personal information are located in countries for which the European Commission and/or UK Government (as and where applicable) have issued adequacy decisions, which means that these countries are recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under applicable UK and/or European data protection laws and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Other recipients of your personal information are located in countries outside the EEA and/or the UK that are not the subject of an adequacy decision. In these cases, we may use the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or, as may be applicable, the International Data Transfer Agreement approved by the UK Government, to help ensure your personal information is protected. For more information on the transfer safeguards we rely on, please contact us by using the details in the “How to contact us” section below. 
Intuit (excluding Credit Karma) and Mailchimp comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland to the United States. Intuit and Mailchimp rely on the EU-U.S. DPF to transfer data and will rely on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF once approved by the appropriate authorities. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. You can find more information about Intuit’s and Mailchimp’s Data Privacy Framework certification

Opt-out of Sales and/or Sharing. 
Like many companies, Intuit and Mailchimp use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you as described above. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may classify our use of some of these services as “sharing” your Personal Information with the advertising partners that provide the services. You can opt-out of the “sharing” of your personal information by visiting the “Your California Privacy Rights” link in the footer of the Intuit website. 
In addition, if you have enabled a recognized opt-out mechanism on your browser, device, or platform, you will automatically be opted out of any “sharings” when you interact with our Services beginning on January 1, 2023. Please go here to learn more about enabling one such preference signal, the Global Privacy Control:

Limit processing of sensitive personal information.
 We only use sensitive personal information as necessary for our (1) Service delivery and operations, (2) compliance and protection, (3) research and development, or (4) Service improvement and analytics purposes in accordance with CCPA.

For Credit Karma members, we may require that you confirm certain pieces of personal information that we have on file and/or log into your Credit Karma account. If we are subsequently unable to confirm your identity, we may refuse your rights request.
Authorized agents.
 You may use an authorized agent to submit a rights request. If you do so, the authorized agent must present signed written authorization to act on your behalf, and you will also be required to independently verify your own identity directly with us and confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the rights request. This verification process is not necessary if your authorized agent provides documentation showing that the authorized agent has power of attorney to act on your behalf under Cal. Prob. Code §§ 4121 to 4130.

We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we have handled your
 
Privacy Rights
.


How do you exercise your rights?


If you, or an authorized agent, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information,

Consumer Privacy Notice
 
for more information about their rights under US federal law.


Understanding your choices


You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.


Choose how we collect Personal Information


You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function at all.


For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Connect profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Connect profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Connect profile for you.


Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information


If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.


You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.


Choose what we disclose with other Users


Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the privacy section in your account settings.


Choose how we communicate with you


Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Connect profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.


You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal or Connect marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.


You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account or Connect profile's status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.


How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?
We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and account/Connect profile registration information and verifying that the Personal Information we maintain about you is accurate and current. We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that we share with a third-party based on a linked account connection that you have authorized.
Can Children Use Our Services?
We do not knowingly collect information, including Personal Information, from children under the age of 13 or other individuals who are not legally able to use our Services. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Information from someone not allowed to use our Services, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data.


Please
 
contact us
 
if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from someone not allowed to use our Services.


We do not sell to third parties for money or share Personal Information of anyone under 16 years of age for cross context behavioral advertising.

What Personal Data Do We Receive?


Personal data is any information from or about an identified or identifiable person, including information that Zoom can associate with an individual person. We may collect, or process on behalf of our customers, the following categories of personal data when you use or interact with Zoom products and services:




Account Information
: Information associated with an account that licenses Zoom products and services, which may include administrator name, contact information, account ID, billing and transaction information, and account plan information.


Profile and Participant Information: 
Information associated with the Zoom profile of a user who uses Zoom products and services under a licensed account or that is provided by an unlicensed participant joining a meeting, which may include name, display name, picture, email address, phone number, job information, stated locale, user ID, or other information provided by the user and/or their account owner.


Contact Information
: Contact information added by accounts and/or their licensed end users to create contact lists on Zoom products and services, which may include contact information a user integrates from a third-party app, or provided by users to process referral invitations.


Settings
: Information associated with the preferences and settings on a Zoom account or user profile, which may include audio and video settings, recording file location, screen sharing settings, and other settings and configuration information.


Registration Information
: Information provided when registering for a Zoom meeting, webinar, Zoom Room, or recording, which may include name and contact information, responses to registration questions, and other registration information requested by the host.


Device Information
: Information about the computers, phones, and other devices used when interacting with Zoom products and services, which may include information about the speakers, microphone, camera, OS version, hard disk ID, PC name, MAC address, IP address (which may be used to infer general location at a city or country level), device attributes (like operating system version and battery level), WiFi information, and other device information (like Bluetooth signals).


Content and Context from Meetings, Webinars, Messaging, and Other Collaborative Features
: Content generated in meetings, webinars, or messages that are hosted on Zoom products and services (“Customer Content”), which may include audio, video, in-meeting messages, in-meeting and out-of-meeting whiteboards, chat messaging content, transcriptions, transcript edits and recommendations, responses to account owner / host-sponsored post-meeting or webinar feedback requests, responses to polls and Q&A, and files, as well as related context, such as invitation details, meeting or chat name, or meeting agenda. Customer Content may contain your voice and image, depending on the account owner’s settings, what you choose to share, your settings, and what you do on Zoom products and services. As referenced below, Zoom employees do not access or use Customer Content without the authorization of the hosting account owner, or as required for legal, safety, or security reasons.


Usage Information Regarding Meetings, Webinars, Messaging, Collaborative Features and the Website: 
Information about how people and their devices interact with Zoom products and services, such as: when participants join and leave a meeting; whether participants sent messages and who they message with; performance data; mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes or actions (such as mute/unmute or video on/off), edits to transcript text, where authorized by the account owner and other inputs that help Zoom to understand feature usage, improve product design, and suggest features; which third-party apps are added to a meeting or other product or service and what information and actions the app is authorized to access and perform; use of third-party apps and the Zoom App Marketplace; features used (such as screen sharing, emojis, or filters); and other usage information and metrics. This also includes information about when and how people visit and interact with Zoom’s websites, including what pages are accessed, interaction with website features including Zoom’s website’s virtual chat feature, and whether or not the person signed up for a Zoom product or service.


Limited Information from Zoom Email and Calendar Services: 
“Zoom Email” refers to Zoom’s native email service and emails sent from Zoom’s native email service. Zoom Email is designed to be end-to-end encrypted by Zoom by default for emails sent and received directly between active Zoom Email users. Support for end-to-end encryption requires Zoom Email users to have added a device to their Zoom Email account with the associated email address and to use a supported Zoom client. When an email is end-to-end encrypted, only the users, and, depending on their settings, account owners, or designated account administrators control the encryption key and therefore access to the email content, including body text, subject line, attachments and custom labels applied to messages by users in their inboxes. Emails sent to or received from non-Zoom Email users are encrypted after the email is sent or received from Zoom’s servers, if the Zoom Email user chooses to send them with encryption. In all cases, Zoom does have access to email metadata used for basic email delivery—specifically, email addresses in the from, to, cc, and bcc fields, time, mimeID, and the number and size of attachments. From use of Zoom’s native calendar service, Zoom receives information regarding meeting invitations, body text, sender and recipients, and other calendar information.


Content from Third-Party Integrations:
 Users can access email and calendars from third-party services through their Zoom client, if they choose to integrate them. This information is not end-to-end encrypted by Zoom, but Zoom employees do not access the contents of third-party-service email or calendar entries, unless authorized to, or required for legal, safety, or security reasons. If account owners and/or their licensed end users integrate their third-party emails with products and services offered or powered by Zoom, such as business analytics tools like Zoom Revenue Accelerator, Zoom may collect or process Customer Content and email information, including email content, headers and metadata, from such third-party services.


Communications with Zoom: 
Information about, and contents of, your communications with Zoom, including relating to support questions, website virtual chats, your account, feedback provided by users to Zoom about Zoom’s products and services (which is owned by Zoom), and other inquiries. .


Information from Partners
: Zoom obtains information about account owners and their users from third-party companies, such as market data enrichment services, including information about an account owner’s company size or industry, contact information, or activity of certain enterprise domains. Zoom may also obtain information from third-party advertising partners that deliver ads displayed on Zoom products and services, such as whether you clicked on an ad they showed you.




In certain jurisdictions, some of the personal data Zoom receives may be considered sensitive. Please see “California & Other U.S. State Privacy Rights” for more information.


How Do We Use Personal Data?


Zoom employees do not access or use Customer Content including meeting, webinar, messaging, or email content (specifically, audio, video, files, in-meeting whiteboards, messaging, or email contents), or any content generated or shared as part of other collaborative features (such as out-of-meeting whiteboards), unless authorized by the account owner hosting the Zoom product or service where the Customer Content was generated, or as required for legal, safety, or security reasons. 
Zoom does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like Customer Content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom’s or third-party artificial intelligence models.


As discussed below, and where technically feasible, Zoom uses personal data to conduct the following activities:




Provide Zoom Products and Services: 
To provide products and services to account owners, their licensed end users, and those they invite to join meetings and webinars hosted on their accounts, including to customize Zoom products and services and recommendations for accounts of their users. Zoom also uses personal data to determine what products and services may be available in your location, and uses personal data, including contact information, to route invitations, messages, or Zoom Emails to recipients when users send or receive invitations, messages, or Zoom Emails using Zoom products and services. This may also include using personal data for customer support, which may include accessing audio, video, files, messages, and other content or context, including information you provide through Zoom’s website’s virtual chat feature, at the direction of the account owner or their users. We also use personal data to manage our relationships and contracts with account owners and others, including billing, compliance with contractual obligations, facilitating payment to third-party developers in relation to purchases made through the Zoom App Marketplace, and related administration.



Advanced Audio and Video Features: If you elect to turn on certain video features, if available in your area, such as filters, studio effects, avatars, and gestures, information about your movements or the positioning of your face or hands may be processed on your device to apply the selected features. Such data does not leave your device, is not retained, cannot be used to identify you, and is only used to generate the selected effects. If certain other features are enabled by the account owner hosting a Zoom product or service, such as transcription generation for recordings, Zoom may use technology that analyzes the meeting’s audio recording to distinguish one speaker from another in order to create an accurate transcript. The audio analysis is not retained after the transcript is generated.



If you elect to turn on personalized audio isolation, software on your device will capture and analyze a clip of your audio from meetings you join to create an Audio Signature used to differentiate your voice from, and suppress background noise in, meetings you join. Zoom does not receive or retain the clip or Audio Signature, which stays on your device and is only used for noise suppression in meetings you join. You may delete the Audio Signature from your device through your Zoom app settings.






Intelligent Features: If enabled by the account owner, Zoom provides intelligent features and products to its customers, their licensed end users and guests, such as Zoom AI or other tools to recommend chat, email or other content. These tools may use artificial intelligence, machine learning, or other technology to process Customer Content solely to provide the intelligent features.










Product Research and Development: 
If authorized by any applicable settings, to develop, test, and improve Zoom products and services, and to troubleshoot products and services. 
Zoom does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like Customer Content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom’s or its third-party artificial intelligence models.


Marketing and Promotions: 
To permit Zoom and/or its third party marketing partners to market, advertise, and promote Zoom products and services, including based on your product usage, information we receive from third-party partners, information you provide to process referral invitations, or if you visit our websites, information about how and when you visit, and your interactions with them. We may also use this information to provide advertisements to you relating to Zoom products and services or to engage third party partners to analyze your interactions on our website or app or to deliver advertising to you. Zoom does not use Customer Content for any marketing or promotions.


Authentication, Integrity, Security, and Safety: 
To authenticate accounts and activity, detect, investigate, and prevent malicious conduct, fraudulent activity or unsafe experiences, address security threats, protect public safety, and secure Zoom products and services. Zoom uses advanced tools to automatically scan certain types of content such as virtual backgrounds, profile images, incoming emails to Zoom’s native email service from someone who is not a Zoom Email user, and files uploaded or exchanged through chat, for the purpose detecting and preventing violations of our terms or policies and illegal or other harmful activity.


Communicate with You: 
We use personal data (including contact information, and information you provide through Zoom’s website’s virtual chat feature, including the content of the messages) to communicate with you about Zoom products and services, including product updates, your account, and changes to our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.


Legal Reasons: 
To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or government agencies, to investigate or participate in civil discovery, litigation, or other adversarial legal proceedings, protect you, us, and others from fraudulent, malicious, deceptive, abusive, or unlawful activities, and to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service or policies.

These vendors can access personal data subject to contractual and technical requirements for protecting personal data and prohibiting them from using personal data for any purpose other than to provide services to Zoom or as required by law. Zoom may integrate third-party technology to provide advanced features, such as Apple’s TrueDepth technology, to process information on your device about your face or hand dimensions and gestures to provide video effects.

Third-Party Developers
: If you purchase a third-party app or integration from the Zoom App Marketplace, Zoom may share information about the purchase with the third-party developer, to provide the app or integration.




Who Can See, Share, and Process My Personal Data When I Join Meetings and Use Other Zoom Products and Services?


When you send messages or join meetings and webinars on Zoom, other people and organizations, including third parties outside the meeting, webinar, or message, may be able to see content and information that you share:




Account Owner: 
An account owner is the organization or individual that signs up for a Zoom account. Typically, an account owner designates one or more people (called an “administrator”) to manage their account and can grant privileges to users on the account. Depending on their license with Zoom, the account owner can authorize additional users on their account, and the account owner can create and/or access the profile information for all users on their account. The account owner and their users can invite others (including guests not on their account and unlicensed participants) to meetings or webinars hosted on their account. Zoom gives account owners controls and features that they can use to determine whether certain types of content, such as recordings or Zoom Team Chat messages, can be created or sent, and what third-party apps can be used, for meetings and webinars hosted on their account. Depending on their settings, account owners and the users they designate can access personal data for participants who join meetings and webinars on their account or send messages to users on their account. Account owners may also be able to determine what information Zoom and others can access and use. Specifically, account owners may have access to:



Account Usage:




Product Usage:
 Information about how users and their devices interact with their account, which may include who sent messages to their users in chat, email addresses, IP addresses, device information, and other information about who joined meetings or webinars on their account, whether their users viewed or downloaded a recording, how long participants participated in their meetings, the time a message was sent, information about Zoom Phone integrations, and other usage information and feedback metrics.


Participant List:
 Information about the participants in a Zoom meeting, webinar, or chat, which may include name, display name, email address, phone number, and participant or user ID.






Registration Information: 
Information provided during registration for a webinar, meeting, Zoom Room, or recording hosted by the account.


Zoom Team Chat and Out-of-Meeting Collaborations: 
 If enabled on their account, account owners and those they authorize can see information about who sent and received Zoom Team Chat messages, including synced in-meeting messages (e.g., from a dedicated meeting group chat that is synced with Zoom Team Chat), to users on their account, along with information about the message (for example, date and time, and number of members or participants). Depending on their settings, account owners also can see sender and receiver information, and other messaging data, along with the content of messages sent to and from users on their account (including from in-meeting chat where dedicated meeting group chats are enabled), unless the account owner has enabled 
Advanced Chat Encryption
. Depending on their settings, account owners and those they authorize may also see the content shared through collaborative features, including whiteboards, files, and images shared in Zoom Team Chat.


In-Meeting/Webinar Messages: 
Depending on their settings, account owners can see sender and receiver information, along with the content of messages sent to and from users on their account, in the following circumstances:



Messages sent to Everyone in a meeting that is recorded


Messages sent to the meeting group chat in a meeting when a dedicated meeting group chat is enabled


Messages sent to panelists in a webinar that is recorded


Messages sent in dedicated meeting group chats in Team Chat


Direct messages if the account owner has enabled archiving


If a participant in a meeting is subject to archiving, their account owner will have access to messages sent to Everyone in the meeting, as well as direct messages sent to that participant. If a participant who is a member of a dedicated meeting group chat is subject to archiving, the member’s account owner will have access to the meeting group chat messages, as well as direct messages sent to that member. If a guest in a meeting with a dedicated meeting group chat is subject to archiving, the guest’s account owner will have access to messages sent to the meeting group chat, as well as direct messages sent to that guest.






Recordings: 
Account owners can watch the content of recordings of meetings and webinars hosted on their account. They can also view, share, and enable advanced features for transcripts of meeting audio.


Polling, Q&A, and Feedback
: Account owners can see information about who provided responses to their polls, Q&A, or post-meeting or webinar feedback requests, including name and contact information, together with the responses or feedback, unless responses are submitted anonymously.


Zoom Email and Zoom Calendar Content: 
Depending on their settings,account owners, and designated account administrators, can access email and calendar content sent to and from users on theirZoom Email or Zoom Calendar accounts, even if those Zoom Emails are encrypted.










Meeting Hosts, Participants, and Invitees: 
Meeting hosts, participants, and invitees may be able to see your email, display name, profile picture, and presence status, including in Zoom meetings and in Zoom’s native calendar service. Meeting hosts, participants, and invitees can also see and (depending on the account owner’s settings) record, save, and share meeting content, audio transcripts, messages sent to Everyone, messages sent to meeting group chats (where enabled, and whether sent in Team Chat or in-meeting), or messages sent to them directly, and files, whiteboards or other information shared with them (including during a meeting, or through a dedicated meeting group chat). Meeting hosts may also share chat transcripts to Zoom Team Chat, depending on their account owner’s settings. Meeting hosts may also be able to see responses to Q&A and polls generated during the meeting.


Zoom Email, Calendar and Zoom Team Chat Recipients: 
Recipients of Zoom Emails and Zoom Calendar invites can see, save, and share your email and calendar content with others, including by sharing emails to Zoom Team Chat. If a recipient shares encrypted content with others, for example, by sharing an encrypted Zoom Email to Zoom Team Chat, or forwarding an encrypted Zoom Email to a third-party recipient without a Zoom Email account, the shared or forwarded content will not be end-to-end encrypted by Zoom. Those with access to your device and login credentials may be able to see, save and share your email and calendar contents on that device. Recipients of Zoom Team Chats can see your messages, reactions, emojis, and related content, including content from Zoom Emails, Zoom Calendar, and emails from third-party services integrated in the Zoom client, that you or a third-party choose to share to Zoom Team Chat, and in-meeting messages that participants send that are synced with Zoom Team Chat through dedicated meeting group chats. Depending on the account owner’s settings, Zoom Team Chat recipients may record, save, or share your messages.


Webinar Panelists and Attendees: 
Only panelists may be visible to attendees during a webinar, but attendees who agree to unmute can be heard by other attendees. If an attendee agrees to become a panelist during a webinar, they may be visible to other attendees, depending on settings. Panelists and attendees may be able to see the name of a participant who asks a question during a Q&A, along with their question, unless the participant submits the question anonymously.


Livestreams: 
Meeting and webinar hosts can choose to livestream to a third-party site or service, which means anyone with access to the livestream will be able to see the meeting or webinar.


Apps and Integrations:




Account owners can choose to add Zoom-developed apps and third-party apps to their account and the Zoom products they use, including via use of the Zoom App Marketplace, and they can also control whether their users can add and use specific Zoom and third-party apps, including in meetings, webinars, and chats hosted on their account.


Account owners can also choose to integrate other content from third-party services– such as third-party email communications on their corporate account – to apps and services that they use, such as Zoom Revenue Accelerator (that provides insights and business analytics related to businesses when they use Zoom products). Further, account owners may choose to have Zoom analyze the meeting’s audio recording to distinguish one speaker from another in order to create an accurate transcript. The audio analysis is not retained after the transcript is generated.


Depending on their settings, account owners’, users’ and guests’ personal data and content may be shared with apps and integrations, including Zoom-developed apps, approved by account owners, which may include all of the personal data categories listed above, such as account information, profile and contact information, registration information, participants list, settings, content, product usage, device information, or third-party emails that have been shared with the app.


Other participants in the meeting may be able to see the app that you are using in a meeting, if the app is receiving content (including audio and video) from the meeting.


Third-party developers may also integrate or embed Zoom meetings into their website or app experiences or build versions of Zoom that enable access to Zoom products from a third-party app.


Personal information shared by account owners and users with third-party apps and integrations is collected and processed in accordance with the app developers’ terms and privacy policies, not Zoom’s.

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data


We only use your information in a lawful, transparent, and fair manner. Depending on the specific personal data concerned and the factual context, when Zoom processes personal data as a controller for individuals in regions such as the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK, we rely on the following legal bases as applicable in your jurisdiction:




As necessary for our contract: 
When we enter into a contract directly with you, we process your personal data on the basis of our contract in order to prepare and enter into the contract, as well as to perform and manage our contract (i.e., providing Zoom products and services, features and services to account owners, their users, and those they invite to join meetings and webinars hosted on their accounts, and manage our relationship and contract, including billing, compliance with contractual obligations, and related administration). If we do not process your personal data for these purposes, we may not be able to provide you with all products and services;


Consistent with specific revocable consents: 
We rely on your prior consent in order to utilize cookies to engage advertising and analytics partners to deliver tailored advertising and analysis of our website usage. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by visiting our cookie management tool, available Cookies Settings;

We process your personal data to comply with the legal obligations to which we are subject for the purposes of compliance with EEA laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or rules applicable to us, and for responses to requests from, and other communications with, competent EEA public, governmental, judicial, or other regulatory authorities. This includes detecting, investigating, preventing, and stopping fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, or illegal activity (“fraud and abuse detection”) and compliance with privacy laws;


To protect your vital interests or those of others: 
We process certain personal data in order to protect vital interests for the purpose of detecting and preventing illicit activities that impact vital interests and public safety, including child sexual abuse material; and


As necessary for our (or others’) legitimate interests, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, which require protection of personal data: 
We process your personal data based on such legitimate interests to (i) enter and perform the contract with the account owner and/or reseller providing you with the products and services (which includes billing, compliance with contractual obligations, and related administration and support); (ii) develop, test, and improve our products and services and troubleshoot products and services; (iii) ensure authentication, integrity, security, and safety of accounts, activity, and products and services, including detect and prevent malicious conduct and violations of our terms and policies, prevent or investigate bad or unsafe experiences, and address security threats; (iv) send marketing communications, advertising, and promotions related to the products and services; and (v) comply with non-EEA laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or rules applicable to us and respond to requests from, and other communications with, competent non-EEA public, governmental, judicial, or other regulatory authorities, as well as meet our corporate and social responsibility commitments, protect our rights and property and the ones of our customers, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.




International Data Transfers


Zoom operates globally, which means personal data may be transferred, stored (for example, in a data center), and processed outside of the country or region where it was initially collected where Zoom or its service providers have customers or facilities – including in countries where meeting participants or account owners hosting meetings or webinars that you participate in or receiving messages that you send are based.


Therefore, by using Zoom products and services or providing personal data for any of the purposes stated above, you acknowledge that your personal data may be transferred to or stored in the United States where we are established, as well as in other countries outside of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Such countries may have data protection rules that are different and less protective than those of your country.


We protect your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement wherever it is processed and take appropriate contractual or other steps to protect it under applicable laws. Where personal data of users in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK is being transferred to a recipient located in a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK which has not been recognized as having an adequate level of data protection, we ensure that the transfer is governed by the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses. Please contact us if you would like further information in that respect.


Zoom complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

EU and UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact Zoom at: privacy@zoom.us.

If you have a question or complaint related to our compliance with the DPF Principles, please contact us as indicated at the bottom of this privacy statement.

 the categories and specific pieces of personal data Zoom has collected, the categories of sources from which the personal data is collected, the business purpose(s) for collecting the personal data, and the categories of third parties with whom Zoom has shared personal data, and 
obtain the personal data
 in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format;


Delete
 personal data under certain circumstances;


Correct 
personal data under certain circumstances; and


Opt out of the “sale” of personal data or “sharing” of personal data for targeted advertising purposes
. We do not sell your personal data in the conventional sense. However, like many companies, we may use advertising and analytics services that are intended to analyze your interactions with our website or app, based on information obtained from cookies or other trackers, including for delivering advertising to you (such as interest-based, targeted, or cross-context behavioral advertising). You can get more information and opt out of the use of cookies and other trackers on our website and app by clicking the 
Your Privacy Choices, also on our homepage, and setting your preferences. You will need to set your preferences from each device and each web browser from which you wish to opt out. This feature uses a cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all cookies from your browser, you will need to re-select your preferred settings. California and Connecticut residents may also set the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information for targeted advertising for each participating browser system that you use. Zoom does not have actual knowledge that it “sells” or “shares” the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.


Appeal
 a denial of your request. Some states provide additional rights to their residents. If we decline to process your request, you may have the right to appeal our decision. You can do so by replying directly to our denial or emailing 
privacy@zoom.us
.








Zoom will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights, which is further in line with your rights under state law.


Sensitive Information
. Zoom receives information that may be considered sensitive under some state laws, such as certain Account Information (e.g., financial information, log-in information) , certain Content and Context from Meetings, Webinars, Messaging, and Other Collaborative Features and certain Limited Information from Zoom Email and Calendar Services (e.g., messaging content in cases described herein) Zoom processes sensitive personal information to provide Zoom products and services, for product research and development, for authentication, integrity, security, and safety reasons, to communicate with you, for legal reasons, and with your consent. Zoom does not use or disclose sensitive personal information (as defined under CCPA) for purposes of inferring characteristics about a consumer, or in any way that would require Zoom to provide a right to limit under the CCPA. Under certain laws, residents may also be permitted to opt out of certain profiling relating to automated processing analyzing certain categories of an individual’s information that would produce a legal or similarly significant effect. Zoom does not engage in this type of profiling of individuals.


To exercise your rights, please click 
here
. California residents may also call +1-888-799-9666. To opt out of the use of cookies on our sites for interest-based advertising purposes, follow the instructions above.


We will acknowledge receipt of your request within 10 business days, and provide a substantive response within 45 calendar days, or inform you of the reason and extension period (up to a total of 90 days) in writing.


These rights are not absolute, are subject to exceptions and limitations, and may not be afforded to residents of all states. In certain cases, we may decline requests to exercise these rights where permitted by law. We will need to verify your identity to process your access, deletion, and correction requests and reserve the right to confirm your state residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to log into your existing Zoom account (if applicable), give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information, such as providing at least two pieces of personal information relating to your account (which will be compared to information we have, such as profile information) or as we otherwise may already have in our possession, such as your email address and phone number. We will verify your consumer request by comparing the information you provide to information already in our possession, and take additional steps to minimize the risk of fraud. You may designate an authorized agent to submit your verified consumer request by providing written permission and verifying your identity, or through proof of power of attorney.

.


California’s Shine the Light Law


Under California’s Shine the Light law, you may also ask companies with whom you have formed a business relationship primarily for personal, family or household purposes to provide the names of third parties to which they have disclosed certain personal information (as defined under the Shine the Light law) during the preceding calendar year for their own direct marketing purposes and the categories of personal information disclosed. You may send us requests for this information to 
privacy@zoom.us
. In your request, you must include the statement “Shine the Light Request,” and provide your first and last name and mailing address and certify that you are a California resident. We reserve the right to require additional information to confirm your identity and California residency. Please note that we will not accept requests via telephone, mail, or facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.


Changes to This Privacy Statement


We may update this Privacy Statement periodically to account for changes in our collection and/or processing of personal data, and will post the updated Privacy Statement on our website, with a “Last Updated” date at the top. If we make material changes to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you and provide you an opportunity to review before you choose to continue using our products and services.

10. Changes to this Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
This privacy policy describes the personal data that Shopify receives and/or processes (which may include collecting, organizing, structuring, storing, using, or disclosing) when you interact with Shopify or use Shopify Consumer Services, as defined in the 
Consumer Terms of Service
, including while shopping with a merchant that uses or is powered by Shopify's platform (“
Shopify Merchants
” or “
Merchants
”). Additionally, please review our 
overall privacy policy
 that applies to everyone whose information we process. If any provisions in this policy conflict with provisions of the overall privacy policy, the provisions in this policy will apply.
2. What Personal Data We Receive
Personal Data is any information from or about an identified or identifiable person, but does not include aggregated or anonymized information. We receive Personal Data when you use or interact with Shopify or Shopify services, which may include the following categories:


Profile and Contact Information
: We receive contact or other profile information when you sign up for or interact with Shopify Consumer Services, which may include name, shipping address, email address, profile picture, or other information you choose to provide us. We may link this information to the different devices or accounts you use when you interact with Shopify or use the Shopify Consumer Services.


Device Information
: We receive information about the computers, phones, and other devices you use or interact with Shopify or Shopify Consumer Services, including IP address (which may be used to determine general location), device identifiers, cookie IDs, the browser you use, your network connection, or other unique identifiers or device information.


Payment Information
: We receive payment information when you use Shop Pay or make a purchase through Shopify services, such as your payment card number and expiration date.


Use of Shopify Consumer Services
: We receive information regarding your use of or interactions with Shopify Consumer Services, whether or not you are logged in to Shopify, such as your interactions with Shopify Merchants, the Shop(s) you visit, the products you view and visit, the product reviews and ratings you post and share, your order history, your interactions with Shop.app/search or other marketing activities related to the Shopify Consumer Services, and favorited Shops.


Settings and Privacy Preferences
: We receive information about your settings and preferences on Shopify and our Merchants, as well as information about your browser and device privacy settings.


Communications with Shopify
: We receive information, including message and email content, when you communicate with Shopify (such as for customer support inquiries, taking surveys, participating in promotions or research).


Social Network Accounts
. If you choose to link, connect, or login to Shopify Consumer Services through a third party online service, you direct the service to send us certain information about you controlled by that service, such as profile information. This sharing is subject to the applicable privacy notices and your privacy settings of that service.


Email and Shopping Service Integrations
. We receive information from email messages in the inboxes that you connect to your Shop account, and information from email messages you transfer to the app to be included in your order history. We do not use this information for advertising or marketing purposes.




3. How We Use Your Personal Data
Shopify uses Personal Data for the following purposes depending on how you interact with us or which Shopify services you use and based on your activity across all devices where you log in to, or interact with, Shopify or Shopify services:


Provide, Improve, and Customize Shopify Services
: To provide customized Shopify services to you, including by displaying your purchase history and order status in one place, providing easy payment options when you shop, recommending products, Merchants and Shop(s) and customizing the products featured for you, and to improve Shopify services, including based on your use of Shopify Consumer Services and activity with our Merchant(s).


Track and Implement Your Privacy Preferences and Settings
: To track and implement your settings and privacy preferences with Shopify and our Merchants.


Perform Product Research and Development
: To develop, test, and improve Shopify services, including troubleshooting our products and services, developing new or improved Shopify services, and analyzing your use of and interactions with Shopify services.


Advertise, Market and Promote Shopify
: To market, advertise, and promote Shopify services on and off Shopify, including for personalized communications or advertisements relating to the Shopify services on third-party services.


Provide Customized Advertising for our Merchants
: To provide advertising services to our Merchants, which may include personalized advertising.


Communicate with You
: To communicate with you about Shopify services, including about product updates, your account, and changes to our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.


Authentication, Integrity, Security, and Safety
: To authenticate your account, provide a secure payment and shopping experience, and to detect, investigate, and prevent malicious conduct, fraudulent activity or unsafe experiences, address security threats, protect public safety, and secure Shopify Services for you and our Merchants.


Legal Reasons
: To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including requests from law enforcement or government agencies, to investigate or participate in civil discovery, litigation, or other adversarial legal proceedings, and to enforce or investigate potential violations of our terms or policies.




Shopify may also aggregate, de-identify, and/or anonymize any information collected through the Shopify services in such a way that we cannot reasonably link information to you or your device. We may use such aggregate, de-identified, or anonymous information for any purpose, including, for example, to improve the Shopify service.
4. How We Process Your Personal Data on Behalf of Shopify Merchants
Shopify also processes your Personal Data from Merchants you interact or shop with in order to help Merchants run their Shop(s) and to provide business services to our Merchants. When Shopify processes Personal Data in this way, we are acting at the direction of the Merchant, and the Merchants' terms of service and privacy policy apply—not Shopify's. For more information about how Merchants collect and use personal information when you visit and make purchases in their Shop(s), review the Merchant's terms and privacy policy.
In addition, some Merchants may instruct us to use Personal Data they share with us for targeted advertising for these and other Merchants using these services on third-party sites. You may have the ability to opt out of allowing a Merchant to share your information with us for these purposes directly on that Merchant's site, such as through the Global Privacy Control. We also offer you choices about how Shopify uses personal information merchants share with us for ad services 
here
.
5. Third-Parties Who May Receive Personal Data
Depending on which Shopify services you use or interact with, Shopify may provide Personal Data to the following categories of third parties:


Vendors
: Shopify works with third-party service providers to provide, support, and improve Shopify services and technical infrastructure, for business services such as payment processing, including in relation to purchases made when you use Shopify Services, and for marketing and business analytics.


Marketing, Advertising, and Analytics Partners
: We may use third-party marketing, advertising, and business analytics partners to deliver personalized advertising and to help us understand how people use or interact with Shopify services and our Merchants. These partners may receive information about your use of, or interactions with, Shopify services, including through third-party cookies or other technologies. For example, we may make information available to third-party advertising companies to serve you with relevant ads or content and to manage, improve and measure our advertising campaigns. Providing information to third parties for personalized advertising services may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising, or “targeted advertising,” as defined by applicable law. You may opt-out of our sharing of Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising by using the relevant settings available 
here
. Please see Your Privacy Rights and Choices below for additional information.


Change of Control
: We may share Personal Data with actual or prospective acquirers, their representatives and other relevant participants in, or during negotiations of, any sale, merger, acquisition, restructuring, or change in control involving all or a portion of Shopify's business or assets, including in connection with bankruptcy or similar proceedings.


Legal Reasons
: We may share Personal Data as needed to: (1) comply with applicable law or respond to, investigate, or participate in valid legal process and proceedings, including from law enforcement or government agencies; (2) enforce or investigate potential violations of its Terms of Service or policies; (3) detect, prevent, or investigate potential fraud, abuse, or safety and security concerns, including threats to the public; (4) meet our corporate and social responsibility commitments; (5) protect our and our Merchants and users' rights and property; and (6) resolve disputes and enforce agreements.


Sharing at Your Discretion
: Where you provide consent, we share your information as described at the time of consent, such as when connecting with a third party application or website.




6. Third Party Partners & Integrations
Parts of Shopify services may link to third party services. Shopify doesn't own or control these third parties. When you interact with these third parties and choose to use their services, your use is subject to the privacy policies of those providers.
7. Your Privacy Rights and Choices
You may have certain rights to manage your Personal Data depending on where you live. To exercise any privacy rights available to you, please visit our 
privacy portal
. Depending on your jurisdiction, the following rights may apply, subject to certain exceptions:


Access and Portability
: Right to request access to your Personal Data.


Correction / Rectification
: Right to correct inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data in certain circumstances.


Deletion / Erasure
: Right to delete Personal Data about you.


Right to opt out of “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising
. Right to opt-out of the “sharing” of your Personal Data for cross context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising (as further described in the Third-Parties Who May Receive Personal Data section).




You can also update your account information or request to deactivate or delete your account directly through your in-app settings. You may have additional rights available to you. Please see our 
overall privacy policy
 for more information.
8. Retention
We retain Personal Data for as long as we have an ongoing business need to do so (e.g., to provide the Shopify services, to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements, for security and fraud detection or prevention, or in connection with backup or disaster recovery processes), unless a different retention period is permitted or required by applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the following:


The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide Shopify services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our services);


Whether you modify or delete your information through your accounts;


Whether Shopify has a legal obligation to keep the data (for example, certain laws require Shopify to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time); or


Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to the enforcement of our agreements, the resolution of disputes, the applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigation).




9. How to Contact Us
To exercise your rights, please visit our 
Privacy Portal
. For questions or concerns related to this Privacy Policy, you may 
contact us

Microsoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.
If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the 
Enterprise and developer products
 section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user of a Microsoft product or a Microsoft account provided by your organization, please see the 
Products provided by your organization

Microsoft account
 sections for more information.
You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data -required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you are using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.

  If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the 
Enterprise and developer products
 section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user of a Microsoft product or a Microsoft account provided by your organization, please see the 
Products provided by your organization
 and the 
Microsoft account
 sections for more information.

You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When you are asked to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to operate and provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to operate and provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use the data will not work for you.
The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make (including your privacy settings), the products and features you use, your location, and applicable law
.

The data we collect can include the following:
Name and contact data
. Your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.

Credentials
. Passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.

Demographic data
. Data about you such as your age, gender, country, and preferred language.

Payment data
. Data to process payments, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number) and the security code associated with your payment instrument.

Subscription and licensing data
. Information about your subscriptions, licenses, and other entitlements.

Interactions
. Data about your use of Microsoft products. In some cases, such as search queries, this is data you provide in order to make use of the products. In other cases, such as error reports, this is data we generate. Other examples of interactions data include:

Device and usage data
. Data about your device and the product and features you use, including information about your hardware and software, how our products perform, as well as your settings. For example:

In addition, IP address, device identifiers (such as the IMEI number for phones), regional and language settings, and information about WLAN access points near your device.
      
Error reports and performance data
. Data about the performance of the products and any problems you experience, including error reports. Error reports (sometimes called “crash dumps”) can include details of the software or hardware related to an error, contents of files opened when an error occurred, and data about other software on your device.
      
Troubleshooting and help data
. Data you provide when you contact Microsoft for help, such as the products you use, and other details that help us provide support. For example, contact or authentication data, the content of your chats and other communications with Microsoft, data about the condition of your device, and the products you use related to your help inquiry. When you contact us, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded.
      
Bot usage data
. Interactions with bots and skills available through Microsoft products, including bots and skills provided by third parties.
      
Interests and favorites
. Data about your interests and favorites, such as the sports teams you follow, the programming languages you prefer, the stocks you track, or cities you add to track things like weather or traffic. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favorites can also be inferred or derived from other data we collect.
  
Content consumption data
. Information about media content (e.g., TV, video, music, audio, text books, apps, and games) you access through our products.
  
Searches and commands
. Search queries and commands when you use Microsoft products with search or related productivity functionality, such as interactions with a chat bot.
  
Voice data
. Your voice data, sometimes referred to as “voice clips”, such as search queries, commands, or dictation you speak, which may include background sounds.
  
Text, inking, and typing data
. Text, inking, and typing data and related information. For example, when we collect inking data, we collect information about the placement of your inking instrument on your device.
  
Images
. Images and related information, such as picture metadata. For example, we collect the image you provide when you use a Bing image-enabled service.
  
Contacts and relationships

. Other inputs provided when you use our products. For example, data such as the buttons you press on an Xbox wireless controller using  the Xbox network, skeletal tracking data when you use Kinect, and other sensor data, like the number of steps you take, when you use devices that have applicable sensors. And, if you use Spend, at your direction, we also collect financial transaction data from your credit card issuer to provide the service. If you attend an in-store event, we collect the data you provide to us when registering for or during the event and if you enter into a prize promotion, we collect the data you input into the entry form.
  
Content
. Content of your files and communications you input, upload, receive, create, and control. For example, if you transmit a file using Skype to another Skype user, we need to collect the content of that file to display it to you and the other user. If you receive an email using Outlook.com, we need to collect the content of that email to deliver it to your inbox, display it to you, enable you to reply to it, and store it for you until you choose to delete it. Other content we collect when providing products to you include:

Communications, including audio, video, text (typed, inked, dictated, or otherwise), in a message, email, call, meeting request, or chat.
Photos, images, songs, movies, software, and other media or documents you store, retrieve, or otherwise process with our cloud.
Video or recordings
. Recordings of events and activities at Microsoft buildings, retail spaces, and other locations. If you enter Microsoft Store locations or other facilities, or attend a Microsoft event that is recorded, we may process your image and voice data.

Traffic data
. Data generated through your use of Microsoft’s communications services. Traffic data indicates with whom you have communicated and when your communications occurred.  We will process your traffic data only as required to provide, maintain, and improve our communications services and we do so with your consent.

How we use personal data
How we use personal data
mainhowweusepersonaldatamodule
Summary
Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:
Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
Improve and develop our products.
Personalize our products and make recommendations.
Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.
We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.
In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.
Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, to build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including artificial intelligence or AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For instance, 
with your permission and for the purpose of improving our speech recognition technologies
, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify. This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.

We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.
For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products). For example, Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law. For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.
Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, to build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including artificial intelligence or AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For instance, 
with your permission and for the purpose of improving our speech recognition technologies
, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify. This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.

    When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the 
Reasons we share personal data
 section of this privacy statement. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the 
Where we store and process personal data
 section of this privacy statement.

More on the purposes of processing:
Provide our products
. We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.
    
Product improvement
. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.
    
Personalization
. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.
    
Product activation
. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation.
    
Product development
. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.
    
Customer support
. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents.
    
Help secure and troubleshoot
. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.
    
Safety
. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. 
In accordance with European Union Regulation (EU) 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 5(1) and 6(1) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery (known as a “hash set”), in a process called “hash matching”. Microsoft obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement authorities.
Updates
. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates.
    
Promotional communications
. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the 
How to access and control your personal data

        section of this privacy statement.
    
Relevant offers
. Microsoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to  predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.
    
Advertising
. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties (Microsoft properties), and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our Microsoft properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the  
Advertising
 section of this privacy statement.
    
Prize promotions and events
. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.
    
Transacting commerce
. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.
    
Reporting and business operations
. We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.
    
Protecting rights and property
. We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.
    
Legal compliance
. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.
    
Research.
 With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard individuals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes.
    
Reasons we share personal data
Reasons we share personal data
mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule
Summary
We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.
Please note that, as defined under certain U.S. state data privacy laws, “sharing” also relates to providing personal data to third parties for personalized advertising purposes. Please see the 
U.S. State Data Privacy
 section below and our 
U.S. State Data Privacy Laws Notice
 for more information.
Full text
We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on OneDrive, or link accounts with another service. If you use a Microsoft product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access Microsoft products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. Additionally, when you save a payment method (such as a card) to your account that you and other Microsoft account holders use to make purchases from Microsoft or its affiliates, your purchase receipts may be shared with anyone else who uses and has access to the same payment method to make a purchase from Microsoft, including the payment method’s named accountholder. When you permit push notifications for Microsoft products or applications on a non-Windows device, the operating system of that device will process some personal data to provide push notifications.  Accordingly, Microsoft may send data to an external, third-party notification provider to deliver push notifications. Your device’s push notification services are governed by their own service-specific terms and privacy statements.
In addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
Finally, we will retain, access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to do any of the following:
Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies. 
Protect our customers, for example, to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.
Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.
Protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services—however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.
For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our 
Law Enforcement Requests Report
.
Please note that some of our products include links to or otherwise enable you to access products of third parties whose privacy practices differ from those of Microsoft. If you provide personal data to any of those products, your data is governed by their privacy policies.

Your communications preferences

    You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your 
communication permissions
 where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this
    
web form
. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.

Your advertising choices
To opt out of receiving personalized advertising from Microsoft, visit our 
opt-out page
. When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.
You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.
For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.
Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection. You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.
You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).
Browser-based controls 
When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features. For example:
Cookie controls
. You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the 
Cookies
 section of this privacy statement. 
Tracking protections
. You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge. This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add. 
Browser controls for ""Do Not Track.""
 Some browsers have incorporated ""Do Not Track"" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.

Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. This data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and honor your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes described below. Microsoft apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows, for similar purposes, and many of our websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.
Our use of cookies and similar technologies
Microsoft uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the context or product, including:
Storing your preferences and settings
. We use cookies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. For example, depending on your settings, if you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft website, we store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. Saving your preferences with cookies, such as your preferred language, prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device. Similarly, in scenarios where we obtain your consent to place cookies on your device, we store your choice in a cookie.
Sign-in and authentication
. We use cookies to authenticate you. When you sign in to a website using your personal Microsoft account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.
Security
. We use cookies to process information that helps us secure our products, as well as detect fraud and abuse.
Storing information you provide to a website
. We use cookies to remember information you shared. When you provide information to Microsoft, such as when you add products to a shopping cart on Microsoft websites, we store the data in a cookie for the purpose of remembering the information.
Social media
. Some of our websites include social media cookies, including those that enable users who are signed in to the social media service to share content via that service.
Feedback
. Microsoft uses cookies to enable you to provide feedback on a website.
Interest-based advertising
. Microsoft uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described in the 
How to access and control your personal data
 section of this privacy statement.
Showing advertising
. Microsoft uses cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen, for example, so you do not see the same one repeatedly.
Analytics
. We use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products.
Performance

Third Party Cookies
In addition to the cookies Microsoft sets when you visit our websites, we also use cookies from third parties to enhance the services on our sites. Some third parties can also set cookies when you visit Microsoft sites. For example:
Companies we hire to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics, place cookies when you visit our sites.
Companies that deliver content on Microsoft sites, such as videos or news, or ads, place cookies on their own.
These companies use the data they process in accordance with their privacy policies, which may enable these companies to collect and combine information about your activities across websites, apps, or online services.
The following types of third-party cookies may be used, depending on the context, service or product, as well as your settings and permissions:
Social Media cookies.
 We and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on our websites. They’re used to connect your activity on our websites to your social media profiles so the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests.
Analytics cookies.
We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better and the third parties can develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by Microsoft. For example, analytics cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.
Advertising cookies.
We and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads by recording which ads you've already seen. They're also used to track which ads you click on or purchases you make after clicking on an ad for payment purposes, and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, they're used to detect when you click on an ad and show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.
Required cookies.
We use required cookies to perform essential website functions. For example, to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, and measure audiences. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.
Where required, we obtain your consent prior to placing or using optional cookies that are not (i) strictly necessary to provide the website; or (ii) for the purpose of facilitating a communication.

As mentioned above, where required, we obtain your consent before placing or using optional cookies that are not (i) strictly necessary to provide the website; or (ii) for the purpose of facilitating a communication. We separate these optional cookies by purpose, such as for advertising and social media purposes. You may consent to certain categories of optional cookies and not others. You also may adjust your choices by clicking “Manage cookies” in the footer of the website or through the settings made available on the website. Certain features of Microsoft products depend on cookies. If you choose to block cookies, you cannot sign in or use some of those features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies will be lost.

Additional privacy controls that can impact cookies, including the tracking protections feature of Microsoft browsers, are described in the 
How to access and control your personal data
 section of this privacy statement.
Our use of web beacons and analytics services
Some Microsoft webpages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.
In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us to, for example, develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website. It also allows us to understand your activity on the website of a Microsoft partner in connection with your use of a Microsoft product or service.

    Finally, Microsoft products often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, or other products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by visiting any of the following sites: 
    
Adjust
,
    
AppsFlyer
,
    
Clicktale
,

.

Other similar technologies
In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or ""Flash cookies"") and Silverlight Application Storage.
Local Shared Objects or ""Flash cookies.""
 Websites that use Adobe Flash technologies can use Local Shared Objects or ""Flash cookies"" to store data on your computer. To learn how to manage or block Flash cookies, go to the 
Flash Player help page

Microsoft account
Microsoft account
mainmicrosoftaccountmodule
Summary
With a Microsoft account, you can sign in to Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favorites. Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalization and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features.
There are three types of Microsoft account:
When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a 
personal Microsoft account
.
When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a 
work or school account
.
When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a 
third-party account
.
If you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.

.
When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a 
third-party account
.
Personal Microsoft accounts
. The data associated with your personal Microsoft account, and how that data is used, depends on how you use the account.
Creating your Microsoft account
. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some products, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign in to and use other Microsoft products without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address, and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft products. For example, people who know your display name, email address, or phone number can use it to search for you on Skype or Microsoft Teams for personal use and send you an invite to connect with them. Note that if you use a work or school email address to create a personal Microsoft account, your employer or school may gain access to your data. In some cases, you will need to change the email address to a personal email address in order to continue accessing consumer-oriented products (such as the Xbox network).
Signing in to Microsoft account
. When you sign in to your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the product you signed in to, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.
Signing in to Microsoft products
. Signing in to your account enables improved personalization, provides seamless and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to access and use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other enhanced features and settings. For example, when you sign in, Microsoft makes information saved to your account available across Microsoft products so important things are right where you need them. When you sign in to your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you in to products that use Microsoft account when you access those products on that device. When you are signed in, some products will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft products, including in your communications, social interactions, and public posts. 
Learn more about your Microsoft account, your data, and your choices
.
Signing in to third-party products
. If you sign in to a third-party product with your Microsoft account, you will share data with the third party in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy. The third party will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and information that describes whether your account has been deactivated. If you share your profile data, the third party can display your name or user name and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) when you are signed in to that third-party product. If you chose to make payments to third-party merchants using your Microsoft account, Microsoft will pass information stored in your Microsoft account to the third party or its vendors (e.g., payment processors) as necessary to process your payment and fulfill your order (such as name, credit card number, billing and shipping addresses, and relevant contact information). The third party can use or share the data it receives when you sign in or make a purchase according to its own practices and policies. 
You should carefully review the privacy statement for each product you sign in to and each merchant you purchase from to determine how it will use the data it collects
.
Work or school accounts
. The data associated with a work or school account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.
If your employer or school uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage the account it provides you, you can use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products, such as Microsoft 365 and Office 365, and third-party products provided to you by your organization. If required by your organization, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. And, if allowed by your organization, you may also use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft or third-party products that you acquire for yourself.
If you sign in to Microsoft products with a work or school account, note:
The owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, including data stored in products provided to you by your organization, and products you acquire by yourself.
Your use of the products is subject to your organization’s policies, if any. You should consider both your organization’s policies and whether you are comfortable enabling your organization to access your data before you choose to use your work or school account to sign in to products you acquire for yourself.
If you lose access to your work or school account (if you change employers, for example), you may lose access to products, including content associated with those products, you acquired on your own behalf if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.
Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organization, which may differ from those of Microsoft.
If your organization is administering your use of Microsoft products, please direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data subject rights, to your administrator. See also the 
Notice to end users
 section of this privacy statement.
If you are uncertain whether your account is a work or school account, please contact your organization.
Third-party accounts
. The data associated with a third-party Microsoft account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account. Your service provider has control over your account, including the ability to access or delete your account. 
You should carefully review the terms the third party provided you to understand what it can do with your account
.
Collection of data from children
Collection of data from children
maincollectionofdatafromchildrenmodule
Summary
For users under the age of 13 or as specified by law in their jurisdiction, certain Microsoft products and services will either block users under that age or will ask them to obtain consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it, including when creating an account to access Microsoft services. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is required to provide for the product.
Once parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. Learn more about personal and school accounts in the 
Microsoft account section
 of the Privacy Statement and 
Microsoft Family Safety
 in the product-specific section. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages. Parents or guardians can change or revoke the consent choices previously made.

Below is additional information about the collection of data from children, including more details as related to Xbox.
Accessing and deleting child data.
 For Microsoft products and services that require parental consent, a parent can view and delete certain data belonging to their child from the parent’s 
privacy dashboard
: browsing history, search history, location activity, media activity, apps and service activity, and product and service performance data. To delete this data, a parent can sign in to their 
privacy dashboard
 and manage their child’s activities. Please note that a parent’s ability to access and/or delete a child’s personal information on their privacy dashboard will vary depending on the laws where you are located.
Additionally, a parent can contact our 
privacy support team
 through the 
privacy support form
 and, following authentication, request that the data types on the privacy dashboard together with the following data be deleted: software, setup, and inventory; device connectivity and configuration; feedback and ratings; fitness and activity; support content; support interactions; and environmental sensor. We process authenticated deletion requests within 30 days of receipt.
Please note that content like emails, contacts, and chats are accessible through in-product experiences. You can find more information about data you are able to control within Microsoft products by visiting our 
Privacy Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
.
If your child’s account is not a part of your Microsoft family group and you do not have access to your child’s activity on your privacy dashboard, then you need to submit a request related to your child’s data through the 
privacy support form
. The privacy team will ask for account verification before fulfilling the request.
To delete all of your child’s personal information, you must request deletion of the child’s account through the 
close your account form
. This link will prompt you to sign in with your child’s account credentials. Check that the page shows the correct Microsoft account, and then follow the instructions to request that your child’s account be deleted. 
Learn more about how to close a Microsoft account
.

After you submit the request to close your child’s account, we will wait 60 days before permanently deleting the account in case you change your mind or need to access something on the account before it is permanently closed and deleted. During the waiting period, the account is marked for closure and permanent deletion, but it still exists. If you want to reopen your child’s Microsoft account, just sign in again within that 60-day period. We will cancel the account closure, and the account will be reinstated.
What is Xbox?
 Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft. Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and enables online experiences crossing multiple platforms. This network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.
When users sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on an Xbox console, we assign a unique identifier to their device. For instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system they are using.
Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.
Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile
. You as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old or as otherwise specified by your jurisdiction. With your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network. During the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group. We collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security. If your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.
We collect limited information about children, including name, birthdate, email address, and region. When you sign your child up for an Xbox profile, they get a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you create your child’s Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharing information based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network. Your child’s privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.
Data we collect
. We collect information about your child’s use of Xbox services, games, apps, and devices including:
When they sign in and sign out of Xbox, purchase history, and content they obtain.
Which games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, play time per game, and other play statistics.
Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and network connection, including any software or hardware errors.
Content they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.
Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.
If your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.
Xbox diagnostic data
. If your child uses Xbox console, Xbox will send required data to Microsoft. Required data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.
Game captures
. Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play. Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your child’s in-game character and gamertag during that session. If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your child’s privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.
Captioning
. During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text. If a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it. This data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the 
Community Standards for Xbox
.
Data use
. Microsoft uses the data we collect to improve gaming products and experiences— making it safer and more fun over time. Data we collect also enables us to provide your child with curated experiences. This includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.
Xbox data viewable by others
. When your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence (which can be set to “appear offline” or “blocked”), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network. Depending on how you set your child’s Xbox safety settings, they might share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network.
Safety
. In order to help make the Xbox network a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we may collect and review voice, text, images, videos and in-game content (such as game clips your child uploads, conversations they have, and things they post in clubs and games).
Anti-cheat and fraud prevention
. Providing a fair gameplay environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity when your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device. In order to detect and prevent fraud and cheating, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention tools, applications, and other technologies. Such technologies may create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) using certain information collected from their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, and how they use that device. This can include information about the browser, device, activities, game identifiers, and operating system.
Xbox data shared with game and apps publishers
. When your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product. This data may include: your child’s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child’s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child’s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.
Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies. You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child’s data. For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services. You may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.

Data Sharing with Games and Apps
.
To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed. Some publisher access to your child’s data may be revoked at 
microsoft.com/consent
.
Managing child settings
. As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, you can manage a child’s information and settings on their 
Family Safety
 page, as well as their Xbox profile privacy settings from their 
Xbox Privacy & online safety page

You can also use the 
Xbox Family Settings

Xbox 360
. This Xbox console collects limited required diagnostic data. This data helps keep your child’s console functioning as expected.
Kinect
. The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control game play. For example:
        
If you choose, the camera can be used to sign in to the Xbox network automatically using facial recognition. This data stays on the console, is not shared with anyone, and can be deleted at any time.
For game play, Kinect will map distances between the joints on your child’s body to create a stick figure representation to enable play.
The Kinect microphone can enable voice chat between players during play. The microphone also enables voice commands for control of the console, game, or app, or to enter search terms.
The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as Skype.

mainsecurityofpersonaldatamodule
Summary
Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption. Microsoft complies with applicable data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.
Where we store and process personal data
Where we store and process personal data
mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule
Summary
Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other jurisdiction where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities. Microsoft maintains major data centers in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Typically, the primary storage location is in the customer’s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data center in another region. The storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate and provide our services efficiently, improve performance, and create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps to process the data that we collect under this privacy statement according to this statement’s provisions and the requirements of applicable law.
We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on 
the European Commission website

Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Microsoft Corporation has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Microsoft Corporation has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. In the context of an onward transfer, Microsoft Corporation has responsibility for the processing of personal data it receives under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. Microsoft Corporation remains liable under the DPF if our agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF, unless Microsoft Corporation can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please 
visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Data Privacy Framework website
. The controlled U.S. subsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the DPF Principles—for more info, see the list of 
Microsoft U.S. entities or subsidiaries adhering to the DPF Principles
.
If you have a question or complaint related to participation by Microsoft in the DPF Frameworks, we encourage you to contact us via our 
web form
. For any complaints related to the DPF Frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, the UK Information Commissioner (for UK individuals), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals. Please contact us if you’d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts. As further explained in the DPF Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means. Microsoft is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Our retention of personal data
Our retention of personal data
mainOurretentionofpersonaldatamodule
Summary
Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.
Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:
Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?
 Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox. In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion). (Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)
Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?
 If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.
Is the personal data of a sensitive type?
 If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.
Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?
 For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.
Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?
 If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.
Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?
 Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.

Advertising
Advertising
mainadvertisingmodule
Summary
Advertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use other data, detailed below, for advertising on our Microsoft properties and on third-party properties. For example:  
Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as 
Microsoft.com
, Microsoft Start, and Bing.
When the advertising ID is enabled in Windows as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.
We may share data we collect with internal and external partners, such as Xandr, Yahoo, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products and their products are more relevant and valuable to you.
Advertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases, and visits; we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads.
The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view. For example, if you view content on Microsoft Start about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars; if you search “pizza places in Seattle” on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in Seattle.
The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our products and sites, and the information we collect about you from the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners. We refer to these ads as ""personalized advertising"" in this statement. For example, if you view gaming content on 
xbox.com
, you may see offers for games on Microsoft Start. To provide personalized advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites. If you opt out of receiving personalized advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.
We may use information about you to serve you with personalized advertising when you use Microsoft services. If you are logged in with your Microsoft account and have consented to allow Microsoft Edge to use your online activity for personalized advertising, you will see offers for products and services based on your online activity while using Microsoft Edge. To configure your privacy settings for Edge, go to Microsoft Edge > Settings > Privacy and Services. To configure your privacy and ad settings for your Microsoft account with respect to your online activity across browsers, including Microsoft Edge, or when visiting third-party websites or apps, go to your dashboard at 
privacy.microsoft.com
.

Speech recognition technologies
Speech recognition technologies
mainspeechrecognitionmodule
Summary
Speech recognition technologies are integrated into many Microsoft products and services. Microsoft provides both device-based speech recognition features and cloud-based (online) speech recognition features. Microsoft’s speech recognition technology transcribes voice data into text. With your permission, Microsoft employees and vendors working on behalf of Microsoft, will be able to review snippets of your voice data or voice clips in order to build and improve our speech recognition technologies. These improvements allow us to build better voice-enabled capabilities that benefit users across all our consumer and enterprise products and services. Prior to employee or vendor review of voice data, we protect users’ privacy by taking steps to de-identify the data, requiring non-disclosure agreements with relevant vendors and their employees, and requiring that employees and vendors meet high privacy standards.

Summary
Enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances collect data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences. The data we collect depends on the features you use, as well as your configuration and settings, but it is generally limited to device and usage data. Customers have choices about the data they provide. Here are examples of the data we collect:
During installation or when you upgrade an enterprise and developer software, we may collect device and usage data to learn whether you experience any difficulties.
When you use enterprise software or enterprise appliances, we may collect device and usage data to learn about your operating environment to improve security features.
When you experience a crash using enterprise software or enterprise appliances, you may choose to send Microsoft an error report to help us diagnose the problem and deliver customer support.
Microsoft uses the data we collect from enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances to provide and improve our products, to deliver customer support, to activate the product, to communicate with you, and to operate our business.
 Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management platform and includes products that can be installed separately (such as SQL Server Management Studio). For detailed information about what data we collect, how we use it, and how to manage your privacy options, visit the 
SQL Server privacy page
. If you work in an organization, your administrator can set certain telemetry settings in SQL Server via Group Policy.
HoloLens
. HoloLens headsets are self-contained Windows computers with Wi-Fi connectivity that enable a mixed reality experience for apps and solutions. Microsoft collects diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows running on HoloLens up to date, secure, and operating properly. Diagnostic data also helps us improve HoloLens and related Microsoft products and services depending on the diagnostic data settings you’ve chosen for your device. 
Learn more about Windows diagnostic data
.
HoloLens also processes and collects data related to the HoloLens experience and device, which include cameras, microphones, and infrared sensors that enable motions and voice to navigate.
If you choose, cameras can be used to sign you in automatically using your iris. To do this, HoloLens takes an image of your iris and measures distances between key points to create and store a numeric value that represents only you. This data stays on the HoloLens and is not shared with anyone, and you can choose to delete this data from your HoloLens at any time.
HoloLens also detects hand gestures intended for system interactions (such as menu navigation, pan/zoom, and scroll). This data is processed on your HoloLens device and is not stored.
HoloLens derives tracking points based on your environment which allows it to understand surfaces in space and allows you to place digital assets on them. There are no images associated with this environmental data and it is stored locally on the HoloLens device. You can choose to delete this data from your HoloLens at any time.
The headset's microphones enable voice commands for navigation, controlling apps, or to enter search terms.

Summary
Productivity and communications products are applications, software, and services you can use to create, store, and share documents, as well as communicate with others.
Microsoft 365 and Office
Microsoft 365 and Office
mainofficeservicesmodule
Summary
Microsoft 365, previous versions called Office 365, is a collection of subscription productivity services and applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, among others. Office is the one-time purchase version of these applications available on PC or Mac. Both Microsoft 365 and Office are comprised of client software applications and connected online services (or web apps in the case of Microsoft 365 for the web) that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences. For more details about Outlook, see the 
Outlook
 section of this privacy statement.  

Various cloud-based Microsoft 365 services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing and Cortana, and third-party connected products. If you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services. You can access the privacy controls within your Microsoft 365 and Office apps. For more information, see 
Account Privacy Settings
.
Office Roaming Service
. The Office Roaming Service helps keep your settings, including your privacy settings, up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365 or Office apps. When you sign in to your apps with either your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the service syncs some of your customized settings to Microsoft servers. For example, the service syncs a list of most recently used documents or the last location viewed within a document. When you sign in to another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. When you sign out of your apps, the service removes your settings from your device. Any changes you make to your customized settings are sent to Microsoft servers.
Updates from Microsoft
. Microsoft uses services such as Click-to-Run, Microsoft AutoUpdate (for Mac), or Microsoft Update (for some versions of Office) to provide you with security and other important updates.
These services can automatically detect the availability of online updates for Microsoft 365 or Office apps on your device and download and install them automatically.
Diagnostic Data
. Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep your Microsoft 365 or Office apps secure and up to date; (ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems; and (iii) make product improvements. This data does not include a user’s name or email address, the content of the user’s files, or information about apps unrelated to Microsoft 365 or Office. Users have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional.
Required
. The minimum data necessary to help keep apps secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device it’s installed on.
Optional
. Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.
See 
Diagnostic Data
 for more information.
Connected Experiences
. Microsoft 365 continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services. A subset of these connected experiences is also available in Office. If you choose to use connected experiences, required service data will be collected to help keep these connected experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected. See below for additional information about required service data.
Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences. There are two types of connected experiences.
Experiences that analyze your content
. Experiences that use your file content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.
Experiences that download online content
. Experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. For example, templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.
You can access the privacy controls within your Microsoft 365 and Office client apps. These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences. For example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content. Turning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage. But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below. These controls are not available when using Microsoft 365 for the web, since you will already be cloud-connected. For more information about accessing these controls, see 
Account Privacy Settings.
If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.
Essential services
. There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 and Office functions and cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential. Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured. See 
Essential Services
 for more information.
Required service data for connected experiences
. As you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience. This data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences. We refer to this data as required service data.
Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. If you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience. Your text and the translation are not stored by our service. Required service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Microsoft 365 or Office app.
See 
Required service data
 for more information.

Microsoft Family
mainmsfamilymodule
Summary
This section applies to the Microsoft Family Safety M365 product, which allows a family group to connect through the Microsoft Family Safety app on their Windows, Xbox, or mobile devices. Please carefully review the information at 
Microsoft Family Safety
 if choosing to create or join a family group.
Microsoft Family Safety can help parents and guardians to create a safer environment for their family group with digital content filtering, screen time limits, spending for Microsoft and Xbox stores, setting age ratings for apps and games, and location sharing. To learn about how Microsoft collects and uses children’s data, see the 
Collection of data from children section
 of the Privacy Statement. If you are using Microsoft Family Safety in Windows, see the 
Windows security and safety features section
 of the Privacy Statement for additional information.
When you have enabled family activity reporting for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their devices, such as search, web, app, and game activity, and provide parents with reports of that child's online activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers.
Certain Family Safety features, such as Location Sharing, Drive Safety, Share Drives, Places, and Location Alerts will use your location information when enabled. When you have enabled Location Sharing, for instance, your device will upload location data to the cloud and share it with others in your family group. Microsoft retains only your last known location as part of the Location Sharing feature (each new location replaces the previous one). When you enable Drive Safety, your location will be used to record your drive habits such as whether you are driving within the speed limits, if you’re using your phone while driving, and if you accelerate or brake suddenly. These reports will be uploaded to the cloud, and you can choose to share your drive reports with your family group. You can turn off these location features at any time in the Family Safety settings. You can manage your device’s location data at the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard.

Microsoft Teams
Microsoft Teams
mainteamsmodule
Summary
This section applies to the consumer offering of Teams; if you are using Teams with a school or work account, see the 
Enterprise and developer products
 of this privacy statement.
Teams is an all-in-one collaboration and communication hub. Teams lets you stay organised and connected across your entire life. Teams allows you to call people with voice or video calling.  Teams allows you to easily find people, files, photos, conversations, tasks, and calendars in one convenient and secure place.  Teams allows you to store confidential information like passwords, rewards numbers, or login information and share it with others within Teams. With your consent, you can share your location with friends and family.
As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects data about the usage of the features as well as information about your communications, including the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the communication. Microsoft may share this information with Enterprise customers when you interact through meetings and chats with end users who are using their school or work account. For instance, if you engage in a Teams chat with a user who is using Teams associated with their school account, Microsoft may share your information with that user's school as part of providing the Teams service.
Teams profile
. Your Teams profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account. To enable other people to find you on Teams (or products that interact with Teams for personal use, including Teams for enterprise) your display name and picture are visible to other users on Teams that have your contact information. Your Teams profile may be visible to Enterprise customers and their end users when you engage with an end user of an organization in chats and meetings. 
Teams contacts
. With your permission, Teams will sync your device, Outlook, and Skype contacts periodically and check for other Teams users that match contacts in your device, Outlook, or Skype address books. You are always in control of your contacts and can stop syncing at any time. If you choose to stop syncing your device, Outlook, or Skype contacts, or you are inactive on your device, any contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization process will be deleted from Teams. If you wish to invite any of your device, Outlook, or Skype contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or Microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via SMS or email for invitations to group conversations. You can block users if you do not want to receive their communications; additionally, you can report a concern to Microsoft.
Notice to non-user contacts.
 If your information appears in the device, Outlook, or Skype address books of a Teams user who chooses to sync their device, Outlook, or Skype contacts with their Teams contacts, Microsoft may process your data in order to determine whether you are a current Teams user and to allow Teams users to invite you to the service, including via SMS and email. As long as the Teams user continues to be active on Teams on their device and continues to enable contact syncing with the applicable device or service, your information will be stored on our servers and we will periodically process your information as a part of the Teams user’s contact syncing experience to check whether you have subsequently joined Teams.

Learn more about how we process your information in connection with the contact syncing feature offered to Teams users
.
If you do choose to join Teams, you will appear as a suggested new Teams contact for any Teams users with your information in their device, Outlook, or Skype address books. As a Teams user, you will be able to block other Teams users if you do not want to receive their communications; additionally, you can report a concern to Microsoft.
Third-party contacts.
 You can also choose to sync contacts from third-party providers. If you choose to unsync your third-party contacts on Teams, all third-party contacts are deleted from Teams. If you gave your consent to use those third-party contacts on other Microsoft apps and services, these contacts will still be available to those other Microsoft apps and services.
You can remove third-party contacts from all Microsoft apps and services by removing third-party accounts from Teams. Please note that removing a third-party account from Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services that also use that third-party account.
Teams calendar.
 You can also choose to sync your Teams calendar with calendars from third-party providers. You can stop syncing your Teams calendar anytime by removing a third-party account from Teams. If you have consented to use third-party data on other Microsoft apps and services, please note that removing this third-party account data in Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services.
Location sharing
. You can share your static or live location with individuals or groups within Teams.  You are in control and can stop sharing at any time.  Sharing location for children is permitted with parental consent and in groups where an adult from the Microsoft family group is present.
Push notifications
. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Teams has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.
If you do not want to use the notification services for incoming Teams calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found on your device.
Chats and meetings with Enterprise customer end users
. Many Microsoft products are intended for use by organizations, such as schools and businesses, as well as individual users. Please see the 
Enterprise and developer products section
 of this privacy statement if you are using Teams with a work or school account. If you engage in Teams meetings or chats with end users of organizations, the data you share with the end users is subject to their organization’s policies, if any. You should direct your privacy inquiries related to your data shared through chats and meetings with an organization’s end users, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to the organization’s administrator. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.
OneDrive
OneDrive
mainonedrivemodule
Summary
OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.
When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.
When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.
When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.
When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.
Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.
Outlook
Outlook
mainoutlookmodule
Summary
Outlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.
Outlook.com
. Outlook.com is the primary consumer email service from Microsoft and includes email accounts with addresses that end in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com. Outlook.com provides features that let you connect with your friends on social networks. You will need to create a Microsoft account to use Outlook.com.
When you delete an email or item from a mailbox in Outlook.com, the item generally goes into your Deleted Items folder where it remains for approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes first. When the Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion, unless we are legally required to retain the data for longer.
Outlook applications
. Outlook client applications are software you install on your device that permits you to manage email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other data from email, file storage, and other services, like Exchange Online or Outlook.com, or servers, like Microsoft Exchange. You can use multiple accounts from different providers, including third-party providers, with Outlook applications.
To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.
When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device. If you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application. If you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.
If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.
To learn more about the data the Outlook applications collect and process, please see the 
Microsoft 365

Partner companies
. To make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companies’ services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that company’s privacy policy governs how it handles your data. To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, transfer, disclose, and preserve your data. That data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails, or file transfers.

Skype Manager
. Skype Manager lets you manage a group’s (such as your family’s) Skype usage from one central place. When you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information, like traffic data and details of purchases, of other members of the group who have consented to such access. If you add information like your name, other people in the group will be able to see it. Members of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager by visiting their 
Skype account page
.

Push notifications
. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service. If you do not want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.

Translation features
. When you use Skype’s translation features, Skype collects and uses your conversation to provide the translation service. With your permission, your data may be used to help improve Microsoft products and services. To help the translation and speech recognition technology learn and grow, sentences and automatic transcripts are analyzed and any corrections are entered into our system, to build better performing services. This data may include manual transcription of your voice clips. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see 
Speech recognition technologies
.

Recording features
. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio / video call. The recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred. 
You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.
 Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.

Skype bots
. Bots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more. Depending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot. Please review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot. You can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with. Prior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.

Captioning
. Certain Skype features include accessibility functionality such as captioning. During Skype calls, a call participant can activate a voice-to-text feature, which allows the user to view the audio chat as text. If a user activates this feature, other call participants will not receive a notification. Microsoft uses this voice and text data to provide captioning of audio for users.

Bing
Bing
mainbingmodule
Summary

  Bing services include search and mapping services, as well as other apps and programs described in this section. Bing services collect and process data in many forms, including text that has been inked or typed, voice data, and images. Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences). 


  When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration. For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see 
Speech recognition technologies
. And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.

AI-powered Bing search
. Bing search now includes an AI-enhanced web search functionality, Bing Chat, which supports users by providing relevant search results, reviewing and summarizing from across the web, refining research queries through the chat experience, and sparking creativity by helping users create content. Bing Chat’s use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bing’s core web search offering as described in this section. More information about the new Bing experience is available at 
The New Bing: Our approach to Responsible AI
.

Search suggestions
. For the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft. This allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches. To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to 
Bing Settings
. There are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser. Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in the search box in Windows 10 and Windows 11. If you choose, you can always hide the search box or icon on the taskbar.

Bing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar
. If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.

Retention and de-identification
. We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.

Personalization through Microsoft account
. Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit 
Bing Settings
 to manage your personalization settings, or the 
Microsoft privacy dashboard
 to manage your data.

Managing search history
. When you’re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search and chat history on the 
Microsoft privacy dashboard
. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Bing chat are also remembered as “Recent activity”. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it. Your Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user. However, if you are using Bing Chat for Enterprise while signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account, your Bing Chat for Enterprise conversations will not be saved or stored.

Third-party services that use Bing
. You may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier). This data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.

Data passed to destination website
. When you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit—such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case, 
https://www.bing.com/
).

Sharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties
. We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties. Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.

mainmsedgemodule
Summary
Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (""standard device data"") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' or online services’ web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Certain features in Microsoft Edge, such as when you open a new tab in the browser, connect you to Microsoft Start Content and your experiences with such content is covered by the Microsoft Start section of this privacy statement. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.
Microsoft Edge for Windows, Linux, and macOS
. Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows 10 and later and is also available on other supported versions of Windows and macOS.
Data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Clear Browsing History.
Microsoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:
Settings and More
. Allows you to manage your favorites, downloads, history, extensions, and collections.
Collections
. Allows you to collect text, images, videos, and other content in a note page in your browser. When you drag content into your collection, it is cached on your device and can be deleted through your collection.
Website Pin to Taskbar
. Allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.
Microsoft collects data necessary to provide features you request in Microsoft Edge. When signed into Microsoft Edge using your Microsoft personal account or work or school account, Microsoft Edge will sync your browser data saved on your device across other signed-in devices. You may choose which browser data to sync, including your favorites, browsing history, extensions and associated data, settings, open tabs, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), passwords, payment information, and other data types as they become available. If you choose to sync extensions that you acquired from third-party web stores, a copy of those extensions will be downloaded directly from those web stores on your synced device(s). If you have turned on Password Monitor, your saved credentials are hashed, encrypted and sent to Microsoft’s Password Monitor service to warn you if your credentials were detected as part of a malicious attack or a breach.  Microsoft does not retain this data after the check is complete. You can disable or configure syncing in the Microsoft Edge settings.
When you sign into Microsoft Edge with your Microsoft personal account or work or school account, Microsoft Edge will store your account’s privacy preferences. Microsoft Edge will use the stored preferences to migrate your account’s privacy choices across your signed-in devices, including during Windows device set up or when you sign into Microsoft Edge with your account on a new device.
Microsoft Edge’s 
Search and site suggestions
 uses your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search recommendations. Microsoft Edge sends the information you type into the browser address bar to the default search provider configured in the address bar to offer search recommendations as you type each character. You can turn off these features at any time in the browser settings. In order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge sends your search queries, standard device information, and location (if you have location enabled) to your default search provider. If Bing is your default search provider, we use this data as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.
Microsoft Edge collects and uses data from your search activity across the web, including websites Microsoft does not own or operate, to improve Microsoft services, such as Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Bing and Microsoft News. This data may include the search query, the search results that are displayed to you, demographic information that is part of the search results, and the interaction you have with those search results, such as the links you click. Microsoft Edge takes steps to de-identify the data it collects by removing data that identifies the person or device from which it was collected and retains this data for one year from when it is collected. Microsoft does not use this collected data to personalize or provide ads to you. You can turn off the collection of this data at any time in the browser settings.
Microsoft Edge downloads content from Microsoft services to enhance your browsing experiences; for example, when data is downloaded to prerender site content for faster browsing or to provide content required to power features you choose to use, such as providing templates for Collections.
You may also choose to share your Microsoft Edge browsing activity to allow us to personalize Microsoft Edge and Microsoft services like ads, search, shopping, and news.

SwiftKey
SwiftKey
mainswiftkeymodule
Summary

    The Microsoft Swiftkey keyboard and related cloud-based services (collectively, the “SwiftKey Services”) process data about words you use and how you type and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you. We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions.


    SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model. This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style. The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey’s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered. The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites. The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data. SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below). When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data. We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products.


    The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account. If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup. When you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.


    You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving Microsoft products and services. Depending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing. These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see 
Speech recognition technologies
.


    If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, Microsoft will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base. This allows us to improve our basic models for individual languages. Language and typing data used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered out.


    You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data or voice clips for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings. You can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings. When you withdraw consent for SwiftKey to retain your personal data, all personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey Services will be deleted.


    You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you. You can disable these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.

Windows
Windows
mainwindowsmodule
Summary
Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files. For more information about data collection in Windows, see 
Data collection summary for Windows

Activation
Activation
mainactivationmodule
Summary
When you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed. The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software. This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license. On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.
Activity history
Activity history
mainactivityhistorymodule
Summary
Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse. Your activity history is created when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge Legacy, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps and is stored locally on your device. If you've signed in to your device with a work or school account and give your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft. Once your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.
You can turn settings off or on for sending your activity history to Microsoft and storing activity history locally on your device, and you can also clear your device’s activity history at any time by going to 
Privacy > Activity history

Advertising ID
Advertising ID
mainadvertisingidmodule
Summary
Windows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use for their own purposes, including providing relevant advertising in apps. When the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie. Thus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web. Microsoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting.
The advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier. You can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in the Windows settings app. If you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated. When a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy. 
Learn more about advertising ID in Windows
.
The advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites. Third-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies. Microsoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft products, both directly and by partnering with third-party ad providers. For more information on how Microsoft uses data for advertising, see the 
How we use personal data
 section of this statement.
Diagnostics
Diagnostics
maindiagnosticsmodule
Summary
Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the “Tailored experiences” setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to tailor Microsoft and third-party products and services for Windows to the customer’s needs. This data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns.
There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data:  Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data. Certain product documentation and other materials refer to Required diagnostic data as Basic diagnostic data and to Optional diagnostic data as Full diagnostic data.
If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage the account it provides to you and enrolls your device in the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration, Microsoft’s processing of diagnostic data in connection with Windows is governed by a contract between Microsoft and the organization. If an organization uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, Microsoft and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of your devices managed by the organization, and for other purposes of the organization.

        Device, connectivity, and configuration data:
        
Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.
Network capabilities and connection data such as the device’s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.
Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.
Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.
Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.
Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.
Whether updates complete successfully or fail.
Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.
Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device. For example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.
Optional diagnostic data
 includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health. Optional diagnostic data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users. When you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:
Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.
Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.  
App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input. 
Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer). 
Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred). Crash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.
Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data. Microsoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample). By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device. Instructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found in the Windows settings app under Diagnostics & feedback.
Specific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described. For example, to enable Microsoft to troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users’ computing experience or update a Windows device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously. For a current list of data types collected at

Feedback Hub
Feedback Hub
mainfeedbackhubmodule
Summary
Feedback Hub is a preinstalled app that provides a way to gather feedback on Microsoft products and installed first party and third-party apps. You can sign into Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or an account provided by your organization (such as your employer or school) that you use to sign into Microsoft products. Signing in with your work or school account allows you to submit feedback to Microsoft in association with your organization.
Any feedback you provide whether using your work or school account or personal Microsoft account may be publicly viewable depending on the settings configured by your organization’s administrators. Additionally, if feedback is provided using your work or school account, your feedback can be viewed through the Feedback Hub by your organization’s administrators.
When you submit feedback to Microsoft about a problem or add more details to a problem, diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft to improve Microsoft products and services. Depending on your Diagnostic data settings in the 
Diagnostics & feedback
 section of the Windows settings app, Feedback Hub will either send diagnostic data automatically or you will have the option to send it to Microsoft at the time you provide feedback. Based on the category chosen when submitting feedback, there may be additional personal data collected that helps to further troubleshoot issues; for example, location related information when submitting feedback about location services or gaze related information when submitting feedback on Mixed Reality. Microsoft may also share your feedback along with the data collected when you submit your feedback with Microsoft partners (such as a device manufacturer, or firmware developer) to help them troubleshoot products and services that work with Windows and other Microsoft products and services.

Location services and recording
Location services and recording
mainlocationservicesmotionsensingmodule
Summary
Windows location service
. Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device’s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely. When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. This de-identified location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see 
https://www.here.com/
) and Skyhook (see 
https://www.skyhook.com
) to improve the location services of the provider.
Windows services and features, apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device’s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so. Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device’s location. For information about certain Windows apps that use the device’s location, see the 
Windows apps
 section of this privacy statement.

    When an app or feature accesses the device’s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you’ve granted permission. We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one). Data about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history. You can clear your device's location history at any time in the Windows settings app.

In the Windows settings app, you can also view which apps have access to the device’s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device’s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device’s location. You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can’t detect a more exact location for your device.

    There are some exceptions to how your device’s location can be determined that are not directly managed by the location settings.	

Desktop apps are a specific type of app that won’t ask for separate permission to discover your device location information and won’t appear in the list that allows you to choose apps that can use your location. They can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store, downloaded from the internet, or installed with some type of media (such as a CD, DVD, or USB storage device). They’re opened using an .EXE, .MSI, or .DLL file, and they typically run on your device, unlike web-based apps (which run in the cloud).  
Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device’s location when the device’s location setting is off
.
Some web-based experiences or third-party apps that surface on Windows could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) or cloud-based location services to determine your device’s location with varying degrees of accuracy even when you’ve turned off the device location setting.

    In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings. If your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device’s location.

General Location
. If you turn on Location services, apps that cannot use your precise location may still have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.
Find my device
. The Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices. To enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled. This feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps. When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area. 
Learn more about Find my device in Windows
.
Recording
. Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others. If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device. In some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly. 
Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.
 Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.

In order to provide this service, Microsoft uses a cloud service to relay your files for the purpose of inserting the photos into web and desktop version of select Microsoft 365 apps, such as PowerPoint, Excel, and Word files.
Security and safety features
Security and safety features
mainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmodule
Summary
Device encryption
. Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology. When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.
Malicious Software Removal Tool
. The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (""malware"") and helps remove any infections found. When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device. During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device. If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.
Microsoft Family
. Parents can use Microsoft Family Safety to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device. Please carefully review the information at 
Microsoft Family Safety
 if choosing to create or join a family group. If you live in a region that requires permission to create an account to access Microsoft services, you may be prompted to request or give parental consent. If a user is under the statutory age in your region, during the registration process they will be prompted to request consent from a parent or guardian by entering an adult’s email. When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers.
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and Smart App Control
. Microsoft strives to help protect your device and passwords from unsafe apps, files, and web content.
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by identifying threats to you, your device, and your passwords. These threats might include potentially unsafe apps or web content that Microsoft Defender SmartScreen discovers while checking websites you visit, files you download, and apps you install and run. When Microsoft Defender SmartScreen checks web and app content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content. When additional analysis is needed to identify security threats, information about the suspicious website or app—such as content displayed, sounds played, and application memory—may be sent to Microsoft. This data will only be used for security purposes in detecting, protecting against, and responding to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, or other malicious, deceptive, or illegal activities. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in the Windows Security app.
Where supported, Smart App Control helps check software that is installed and runs on your device to determine if it is malicious, potentially unwanted, or poses other threats to you and your device. On a supported device, Smart App Control starts in evaluation mode and the data we collect for Microsoft Defender SmartScreen such as file name, a hash of the file’s contents, the download location, and the file’s digital certificates, is used to help determine whether your device is a good candidate to use Smart App Control for additional security protection. Smart App Control is not enabled and will not block during evaluation mode.  Some devices may not be good candidates if Smart App Control would otherwise get in the way and interfere with a user’s otherwise intended and legitimate tasks – for instance, developers who use a lot of unsigned files. If you are a good candidate for Smart App Control, then it will automatically be turned on, and will provide additional protection to your device beyond Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. Otherwise, Smart App Control will be unavailable and permanently turned off. If your device is unsupported or not a good candidate for Smart App Control, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will continue to help protect your device. When Smart App Control is enabled and identifies an app as malicious, potentially unwanted, or unknown and unsigned, it will block and notify you prior to opening, running, or installing the app. 
Learn more about Smart App Control
.
When either Microsoft Defender SmartScreen or Smart App Control checks a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file’s contents, the download location, and the file’s digital certificates.
Smart App Control can be turned on or off in the Windows Security app.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus
. Microsoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device. Microsoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device. If Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device. When Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection. If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent. You can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.
Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and Typing
Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and Typing
mainspeechinkingtypingmodule
Summary
Speech
. Microsoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.


    Turning on the Online speech recognition setting lets apps use Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition. Additionally, in Windows 10, the Online speech recognition setting enables your ability to use dictation within Windows.


    Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions. Both device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled. With both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies.


    When you use cloud-based speech recognition technologies from Microsoft, whether enabled by the Online speech recognition setting or when you interact with HoloLens or voice typing, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to provide the speech recognition service by creating a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data. Microsoft will not store, sample, or listen to your voice recordings without your permission. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see 
Speech recognition technologies
.


    You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft. However, Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition technologies provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition. When the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that do not rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition—like the live captions app, the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app—will still work and Microsoft won’t collect any voice data.


    You can turn off online speech recognition at any time. This will stop any apps that rely on the Online speech recognition setting from sending your voice data to Microsoft. If you are using a HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time. This will stop the device from listening for your voice input. 
Learn more about speech recognition in Windows
.

Voice Activation
. Windows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app—for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond when you say “Cortana.”

If you’ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows  will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords. Once a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer. The app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands. Each app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.
Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked. If enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device. When the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.

    You can turn off voice activation at any time. 
Learn more about voice activation in Windows
.


    Even when you’ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input. 
Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to access your microphone even with these settings turned off
.

Voice typing
. In Windows 11, dictation has been updated and renamed as voice typing. Voice typing may use both device-based and online speech recognition technologies to power its speech-to-text transcription service. You can also choose to contribute voice clips to help improve voice typing. If you choose not to contribute voice clips, you can still use voice typing. You can change your selection anytime in the voice typing settings. Microsoft will not store, sample, or listen to your voice recordings without your permission. 
 Learn more about Microsoft and your voice data
.

Voice access
. Windows enables everyone, including people with mobility disabilities, to control their PC and author text using their voice. For example, voice access supports scenarios like opening and switching between apps, browsing the web, and reading and authoring mail. Voice access leverages modern, on-device speech recognition to accurately recognize speech and is supported without an internet connection.

mainwebbrowsersmodule
Summary
This section applies to legacy versions of Microsoft Edge (versions 44 and below). See the 
Microsoft Edge
 section of the Privacy Statement for information about non-legacy versions of Microsoft Edge.
Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows. Internet Explorer, the legacy browser from Microsoft, is also available in Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (""standard device data"") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.
Additionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History.
Microsoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:
Web note
. Allows you to create ink and text annotations on the webpages you visit, and clip, save, or share them.
Active reading
. Allows you to create and manage reading lists, including websites or documents.
Hub
. Allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area.
Website Pin to Taskbar
. Allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.
Some Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account. For instance, in Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites, reading lists, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), and may include data for extensions that you have installed. As an example, if you sync your Microsoft Edge reading list across devices, copies of the content you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for later viewing. You can disable syncing in Internet Explorer by going to 
Start
 > 
Settings
 > 
Accounts
 > 
Sync your settings
. (For more information, see the

Windows apps
Windows apps
mainwindowsappsmodule
Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app
. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the 
Bing
 section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the 
Sync and backup settings
 section of this privacy statement.
Camera app
. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app
. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. 
Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping
.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app
. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app
. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app
. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows 
Location services
 section of this privacy statement.
Narrator
. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to 
Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links
 in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback.  If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions
. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content.  Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft.

Windows Media Player
Windows Media Player
mainwindowsmediaplayermodule
Summary
Windows Media Player allows you to play CDs, DVDs, and other digital content (such as WMA and MP3 files), rip CDs, and manage your media library. To enrich your experience when you play content in your library, Windows Media player displays related media information, such as album title, song titles, album art, artist, and composer. To augment your media information, Windows Media player will send a request to Microsoft which contains standard computer information, an identifier for the media content, and the media information already contained in your Windows Media Player library (including information you may have edited or entered yourself) so that Microsoft can recognize the track and then return additional information that is available.
Windows Media Player also allows you to play back content that is streamed to you over a network. To provide this service, it is necessary for Windows Media Player to communicate with a streaming media server. These servers are typically operated by non-Microsoft content providers. During playback of streaming media, Windows Media Player will send a log to the streaming media server or other web server(s) if the streaming media server requests it. The log includes such details as: connection time, IP address, operating system version, Windows Media Player version, Player identification number (Player ID), date, and protocol. To protect your privacy, Windows Media Player defaults to sending a Player ID that is different for each session.

Xbox
Xbox
mainxboxmodule
Summary
The Xbox network is the online gaming and entertainment service from Microsoft that consists of software and enables online experiences across different platforms. This service lets you find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.
When you sign up for an Xbox profile, we assign you a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you sign in on Xbox devices, apps, and services, the data we collect about your use is stored using these unique identifier(s).
Xbox consoles are devices you can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment. When you sign in to Xbox experiences—in apps or on a console—we also assign a unique identifier to your device. When your Xbox console is connected to the internet, for instance, and you sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system you’re using.
Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as the Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected.
Data we collect
 about your use of Xbox services, games, apps, and consoles includes:
When you sign in and sign out of Xbox, any purchases you make, and content you obtain.
Which games you play and apps you use, your game progress, achievements, play time per game, and other play statistics.
Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and your network connection, including any software or hardware errors.
Content you add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video you capture in games and apps.
Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections you make (friends you add and people who follow you) on the Xbox network.
If you use an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time you sign in to Xbox, even if you’ve been playing offline.
Xbox diagnostic data
. Diagnostic data has two categories: required and optional.
Required
. Xbox will send required data to Microsoft. The minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.
Optional
. Optional data is additional data that you choose to share with Microsoft. Optional data may include additional details about the operation, usage, and performance of your Xbox products and services, as well as enhanced error reporting.

Game captures
. Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play. Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your in-game character and gamertag during that session. If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat.
Captioning
. During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text. If a player activates this feature, all voice communication in the party is captioned for the player. Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it, as well as the other purposes described in this statement.
Data use
. Microsoft uses the data we collect to improve gaming products and experiences—making them safer and more fun over time.
Data we collect also enables us to provide you with curated experiences. This includes connecting you to games, content, and services, as well as presenting you with offers, discounts, and recommendations. To change your settings for purchase recommendations, visit

ANALYTICS,

including data collected when you speak to and use voice ordering services
through the Domino's Anyware platform.


In addition, we engage other
entities to serve advertisements on the Web Sites and Applications and/or on
other services. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies

We also use audience matching
services (which is a type of Interest-based Advertising) to reach people (or
people similar to people) who have visited our Web Sites, Applications, or are
identified in one or more of our databases (""Matched Ads""). This is
done by us uploading a customer list to a technology service or
programmatically by incorporating technologies such as pixels, SDKs, or APIs
from a technology service into our own Web Sites or Applications, and the
technology service matching common factors between our data and their data. For
instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel on our Web Sites and may share your
email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences.
Some technology services may provide us with their own data, which is then
uploaded into another technology service for matching common factors between
those datasets.


As indicated above, the entities
providing these services may act as our service providers, or in certain
contexts, independently decide how to process your information. Information
collected by these services may be transmitted to and stored on servers in the

the Web Sites and Applications. You may correct, update, amend, delete, or

account or contacting us as set forth in the section entitled ""Contact

Tracking Technologies Generally


Most web browsers (such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Apple Safari) accept
cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to
decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you
will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is
subject to your browser settings and limitations.


For Apple iOS, we will only
receive access to your device’s Ad ID (known as an IDFA) if you provide
consent. You can reset your device advertising Id at any time through your
device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information
collected about you. For information on how to do this on Apple devices, visit
Apple.com or https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074. For information on how
to do this on Android devices, visit Google.com. You can stop all collection of
information via an app by uninstalling the app.


The location data collected
through an app depends on your device settings and app permissions. You can
exercise choice over the location data collected through our apps by (i) for
GPS data, disabling location in your device settings or disabling location
permissions to that app; (ii) for Bluetooth data, disabling Bluetooth and any
Bluetooth scanning option in your device settings; or (iii) for WiFi data,
disabling WiFi and any WiFi scanning option in your device settings. You can
stop collection of all location data via an app by uninstalling the app.


Your browser settings may allow
you to automatically transmit a ""Do Not Track"" signal to online
services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what
site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly,
unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, Domino's Pizza
does not respond to ""Do Not Track"" signals or other mechanisms. For
more information on ""Do Not Track,"" visit

device tracking features, however, you may not be able to use certain functions
of the Web Sites or Applications.

disclose this personal information to the categories of persons set out in the

Domino's Pizza does not sell your

non-precise geolocation data and inferences. The categories of third parties to

sensitive personal information as those terms are defined by CPRA.
 


Retention


We retain each category of
personal information, including sensitive personal information, for the length
of time that is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it was
collected, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,

effort.

sensitive personal information.

in the link below 
or call our toll free number at 877-883-9641. If you have
an account with us, we may require you to use the account to submit the

you submitted the opt-out because the connection between your browser
identifiers and other personal information we have about you is not known to

as requested through this

ADDITIONAL
DISCLOSURES FOR DATA SUBJECTS IN EUROPE


The General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”) provides additional rights to individuals located in the
European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (collectively,
“Europe”). This section addresses those rights and applies only to those
individuals. 


Roles


Data protection laws in Europe
distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own
purposes (known as ""controllers"") and organizations that process
personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as
""processors""). Domino's Pizza LLC acts as a controller with respect
to personal data collected as you interact with our websites, emails, and
advertisements. In some instances, Domino's Pizza acts as a processor on behalf
of the Domino's Pizza franchisees, which are independent entities. Any
questions that you may have relating to the processing of personal data by
Domino's Pizza as a processor should be directed to the relevant franchisee.


Lawful Basis for
Processing


Data protection laws in Europe
require a ""lawful basis"" for processing personal data. Our lawful
bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or
more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers, partners, or
franchisees; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with
you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d)
processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do
not override those interests. Some of our lawful bases for processing your
information stem from our independent franchisees on whose behalf we provide
services.


Your European Privacy
Rights


You have the right to access,
rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you. You also have
the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our
processing of personal data we have collected about you. In addition, you have
the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third
parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different
than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based
on consent you have provided to us.


To exercise any of these rights,
contact us as set forth in the section entitled ""Contact Us"" above
and specify which right you intend to exercise. We will respond to your request
within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to
confirm your identity. Further, if we are processing your information on behalf
of one of our franchisees, we will refer you to that franchisee, and will
support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your
request. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfil the
purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the
information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate
interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.


If you have any issues with our
compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EEA supervisory
authority.


Data Transfer and Privacy
Shield


Domino’s Pizza uses standard
contractual clauses to provide the required safeguards for the transfer and
processing of personal data from Europe.


In addition, despite its
invalidation, Domino's Pizza maintains its participation in the EU-U.S. Privacy
Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by
the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., respectively. Domino's
Pizza has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the
Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward
transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, and
recourse, enforcement and liability. For purposes of this section, Domino's
Pizza refers to the following U.S. legal entities: Domino's Pizza LLC, Domino's
Pizza Distribution LLC, Domino's Pizza International Franchising Inc, and
Domino's Pizza International Payroll Services, Inc.


In accordance with our
obligations under the Privacy Shield, and subject to the investigatory and
enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, we hereby affirm our
commitment to subject all personal data transferred from the EU and Switzerland
to the Privacy Shield Principles. This means that, in addition to our other
obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles, we shall be liable to you for
any third-party agent to which we transfer your personal data and that
processes such personal data in a manner that violates the Privacy Shield
Principles, unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the
resulting damages.


For inquiries or complaints
regarding our compliance with Privacy Shield, please contact us as set forth in
the section entitled ""Contact Us"" below. If we are unable to resolve
your complaint directly, you may submit your complaint at no cost to you to the
JAMS at 
https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield
. In the
event there are residual complaints that have not been resolved by JAMS, or any
other means, you may seek a non-monetary remedy through binding arbitration to
be provided to you in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles.

Shield Framework, and to view Domino's Pizza's certification, please

It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.


With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared. 


So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:


 








































X is a public platform










Learn what’s viewable & searchable
























We collect some data

about you










Learn what we collect & how
























Affiliate services may have their own policies










Learn about affiliates














































We use your data to make X better










Learn how we make your info work
























You can control your experience










Learn how to update your settings
























If you have questions about how we use data, just ask










Learn how to contact us

















































































          Seriously — what happens with my data?
        















































































































          Seriously — what happens with my data?
        





































































          What data do you collect about me?
        














You give some data, we get some data. In return we offer useful services. Not what you had in mind? Check your settings.
















 






































1. Information We Collect


The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.


Expand dropdowns for more information:




























1.1 Information you provide us.



















































To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.




Personal Accounts.
 If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise. 




Professional Accounts.
 If you create a 
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. 




Payment Information.
 In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.




Preferences.
 When you set your preferences using your 
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.




Biometric Information.
 Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.




Job Applications / Recommendations.
 We may collect and use your personal information (such as your employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, job search activity and engagement, and so on) to recommend potential jobs for you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable employers to find potential candidates, and to show you more relevant advertising.




















































1.2 Information we collect when you use X.




























































































When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.

 























 Usage Information.
 We collect information about your activity on X, including:




Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and communities you are a part of.


Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).


How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to 
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use 
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.


If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.


We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).




Purchase and payments.
 To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.


Device Information.
 We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:




Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.


Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.


Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.






















































Location Information. 
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.

























 Inferred Identity.
 We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:






When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identifiers).


When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.


When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.






















































Log Information.
 We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:




IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identifiers; and identifiers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.

























 Advertisements.
 When you view or interact with ads we serve on or off X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad). 




Cookies and similar technologies.
 Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public profiles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies 
here
.


Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
 When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.

 
















































1.3 Information we receive from third parties.



















































When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
 



 Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
 Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
 
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
 
generates, or infers
 
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.


Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
 We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our 
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.

 

























































































          How do you use my information?
        














To make X the service you know and love.




























































2. How We Use Information


Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always 
contact us
. Here we go:


Expand dropdowns for more information:

 




























 


















2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.



















































We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover 
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.



We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.


We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.




















































We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your 
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.




























































2.2  Foster safety and security.



















































We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.

 
















































2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.



















































We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.
















































2.4 Communicate with you about our services.



















































We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.
















































2.5 Research.



















































We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.



































































































          My posts are public?!?
        







































































































          My posts are public?!?
        





































































          How or when do you share my information?
        














There’s no quick answer to this one, but heads up: posts can end up in the news or a search engine.




































3. Sharing Information


You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.


Expand dropdowns for more information:

 


































 












3.1 When you post and share.



















































 With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X, for example from search query results on Internet search engines.




With other X users.
 Depending on your 
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:




Your interactions with X content of other users, such as likes, and people you follow.


Content you send to a specific X user, such as through 
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.




With partners.
 Depending on your 
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our 
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your 
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this 
Help Center
 article.)

 
















































3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.



















































 With service providers.
 We may share your information with our 
service providers
 that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services. 


With advertisers.
 Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.


Third-party content & integrations.
 We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you 
authorize a third-party web client or application
 to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
 
autoplay settings
 if you prefer that content not to play automatically.


Through our APIs.
 We use technology like
 
APIs
 and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have 
standard terms
 that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit 
https://developer.x.com
.

 
















































3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.



















































We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:




comply with a law, regulation, 
legal process, or governmental request
;




protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;




explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of 
Our Rules
);




address fraud, security, or technical issues; or




protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.




















































3.4 With our Affiliates.



















































We may share information amongst our 
affiliates
 to provide our products and services.
















































3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.



















































We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.



























































































          Does data have an expiration date?
        















































































































          Does data have an expiration date?
        





































































          How long do you keep data?
        














Generally, we keep your data as long as your account is up.




































4. How Long We Keep Information



We keep different types of information for different periods of time: 




We keep your profile information and content for the duration of your account.




We generally keep other personally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.




Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after you remove it from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility 
here
.




Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (i.e., email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.




We may keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.







































































          How can I control my data?
        














You can access it, delete it, or change your settings. Basically, you’re the boss.




































5. Take Control




Expand dropdowns for more information:

 








































5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.



















































You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account 
settings
.




You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
 
Your X Data
 and request access to additional information
 
here
.




You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions 
here
.






To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.


















































5.2 Deleting your Information.



















































If you follow the instructions 
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
















































5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.



















































You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
 
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a 
Space
 is recorded, or whether 
videos you upload
 are downloadable by others.



X adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising at 
https://optout.aboutads.info/
.
















































5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.



















































To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.

























































































          How does X handle my information wherever I am?
        














We treat your information fairly, no matter where you live around the world.




































6. Your Rights and Ours


We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.


Expand dropdowns for more information:

 








































6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.



















































X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out 
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information. 

 
















































6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.



















































Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.


We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage 
our affiliates
 and third-party partners and 
service providers
 located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on 
standard contractual clauses
 (SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us 
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.

































































          Is X for kids?
        














Nope, X is not intended for people under 13.




































7. X's Audience


Our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).



















































































          You there, X?
        

































































































          You there, X?
        





































































          Will this policy change?
        














If it does, we’ll let you know.




































8. Changes To This Privacy Policy




The most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed.


If we do revise this Privacy Policy and make changes that are determined by us to be material, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to review the revised Privacy Policy before you continue to use X.



































































          Is this policy viewable in other languages?
        














Yes, but...




































9. General




The X Privacy Policy is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English language version of the X Privacy Policy shall take precedence. You acknowledge that English shall be the language of reference for interpreting and constructing the terms of the X Privacy Policy.

      name or account number (e.g. your userID), email address or other
      identifiers needed to link your online account with our Services.
    




Creation of a Crazy Maple Studio account.
 We will collect certain
      information from you during the registration/ sign-up process for the
      Services. This may include information like your name, locale, phone
      number, or email address.

 Our Services may allow you to create, upload or
      share content such as text, images, audio, your profile information
      (such as your avatar name and appearance) or other content you create
      when you play our games or otherwise use our Services,
    




Facebook Connect, Game Center, and Google+:
 You may be able to
      log in to our Services using sign-in services (“Social Login”) such as
      Facebook Connect, Apple’s Game Center, or an Open ID provider. These
      third party Social Login platforms will authenticate your identity and
      provide you the option to share certain personal information with us
      such as your name or email address to pre-populate our sign up form.
      Social Login platforms like Facebook Connect give you the option to post
      information about your activities on our Services to your profile page
      on such Social Login platform to share with others within your network.
    



      We may collect and record information through the relevant Social Login
      platform in accordance with the policies and terms of that Social Login
      platform. The information we collect when you connect your user account
      to a Social Login platform may include: (1) your name, (2) your Social
      Login's user identification number and/or user name, (3) locale, city,
      state and country, (4) sex, (5) birth date, (6) email address, (7)

      identification numbers for your friends that are also connected to Crazy
      Maple Studio game(s).
    




Invite a Friend:
 Crazy Maple Studio may offer you the opportunity
      to invite your contacts from a Social Login platform (such as your
      Facebook friends) so that those contacts can be located in Crazy Maple
      Studio games and/or you can invite them to join you in our games. Such
      contact information will be used only for the purpose of sending the
      invitation to the addressee(s).
    




Interaction with Customer Service:
 We may collect your email
      address and any other personal information you provide to us when you
      contact our customer service or otherwise communicate with us.
    




Forums, Sweepstakes, Contests and Surveys:
 We may also acquire
      information from you through (1) your access and participation in forums
      or in game chats on the Services, or (2) your participation in surveys
      regarding the Services. We may also provide you the opportunity to
      participate in a sweepstakes or contest through our Service. If you
      participate, we will request certain personal information from you.
      Participation in these sweepstakes and contests are voluntary and you
      therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The
      requested information typically includes your contact information (such
      as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
      code or equivalent). We use this information to administer the
      sweepstakes or contest and to notify winners and award prizes. We may
      use a third party service provider to conduct these sweepstakes or
      contests; in such case, that company is prohibited from using your
      personal information for any other purpose.
    




Information Collected Automatically
: When you
      interact with or use our Services, we automatically collect certain
      information about your device and your use of our Services. This could
      include information such as your, browser type and language, IP address,
      device ID, hardware and software information, advertising ID, gameplay
      data, standard sever log information, your connections and interactions
      with other users, purchase histories with us and social media data (if
      you have linked your account and in accordance with your sharing
      permissions). We (or the third parties we work with) use standard
      tracking technologies (like log files, software development kits (SDKs)
      and web beacons) to do this. In addition, we or our partners may also
      use tracking technologies and advertising IDs to serve personalized ads
      to you in our Services. Please see the section below relating to
      Tracking Technologies [INSERT LINK TO COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
      SECTION] for more details.
    




Mobile Platforms:
 When you play or otherwise use any of our
      mobile games or applications, we or third party partners will collect
      and process certain information about you, including your unique device
      ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, device maker, media
      access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity
      (“IMEI”), the type and version of your operating system (“OS”), language
      of the OS, your unique device ID, your time zone, the screen size of
      your device, mobile device Advertising ID (known as “IDFA” for iOS
      devices, or “Android Advertising ID” for Android devices), your general
      geolocation information (city/country based on your Internet Protocol
      (“IP”) address) and your email address (if you have connected to
      Facebook or Google+). This information is useful to us for
      troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends so that we can
      improve and personalize the Services for our users. Device identifier /
      information such as device type, hardware model, device maker, device
      operating system and its language or other technical data like screen
      size, or combination of this data, is also collected and used to
      determine device compatibility and optimal settings. We may also share
      this information with our advertising partners to enable the technical
      delivery of personalized ads to your device, as further described below
      [LINK TO INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING SECTION].
    




User ID:
 When you register to use the Services, we create a
      unique user ID to track your use of our Services. Specifically, this
      unique user ID is stored in connection with your profile information to
      track the Crazy Maple Studio games you are playing.
    




Game Data Collection:
 We collect gameplay information about how
      you use and play our games. For example, we automatically collect data
      such as your game session time, your in-game interactions (including
      with other players, where applicable), in-app purchases that you may
      make, resource events such as the acquisition or spend of in-game
      virtual currencies by you, progression events that are used to mark your
      progress or movement within the game (e.g. achievements) and install
      timestamps. This information may be associated with your user ID, IP
      address or device ID for the purpose of providing you our Services and
      improving and personalizing them, or to make inferences regarding your
      preferences, predispositions, behavior, abilities and aptitudes. With
      your consent, we will also collect your exact or precise location so
      that we are able to match you with other players in your area.
    




Mobile Analytics:
 Like most mobile applications, we use mobile
      analytics tools to collect certain information about your usage of our
      mobile applications and games, as well as on your device and the health
      of our Services to allow us to better understand the functionality of
      our Services on your device and for app optimization purposes. Such
      tools may record information such as how often you use the application
      or game, feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, events that occur
      within the application or game, aggregated usage and performance data,
      and where the application or game was downloaded from (i.e. which
      application store).
    



      We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to
      any information that personally identifies you within the mobile
      application.
    







      Our Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information Automatically
    


A. Tracking Technologies



      We and our third party partners, affiliates, or analytics service
      providers use standard tracking technologies (like web beacons, SDKs,
      APIs, scripts and tags) to identify your computer/device, to “remember”
      things about your visit or your use of the Services (such as your
      preferences or a user name) and to help us understand things like, what
      pages and features you use and the games you play.
    



      Such information may be linked to or combined with other personal
      information we process about you, such as your user ID, for purposes
      such as improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations
      to your interests, providing and personalizing our Services including
      making our Services easier to use, and for fraud prevention, security
      and authentication purposes.
    



      Please refer to guidance provided by your device manufacturer, operating
      system developer, or individual web browser if you would like help in
      managing your preferences with respect to tracking technologies used on
      our Services.
    


B. Interest-Based Advertising



      Some of our Services employ ad-serving technologies that use cookies,
      clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies
      to deliver interest-based advertising to you about third party products
      and services. We may via our third party advertising partners, also
      advertise our Services to you on third parties’ websites. You may also
      see our games advertised in other services (like on Facebook). After
      clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you
      will become a user of our Services.
    



      When you play our games or otherwise use our apps, some third party
      tools (SDKs) integrated within our Services may collect and use certain
      information collected from your device for the purpose of ad display and
      optimization. Such information includes GAID (Google Advertising ID on
      Android devices) or IDFA (Identifier for Advertising on iOS devices),
      region (i.e. the location where a given language is used), geo-location
      information (with your consent) and IP address. This Policy does not
      govern our third-party advertising partners, as they have their own
      privacy policies, which are accessible using the links provided below.
      We have no access to or control over such third parties. In addition to
      identifiers, these third parties may also collect information relating
      to:
    


Advertisements served and the location of the ad;


Length of time an advertisement was visible;


Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and


Click-throughs (i.e. whether a click was made on the ad) and advertisement response.







      They use this information (alone or in combination with information they have collected about you when you use
      third party websites or services) to: (i) enable the technical delivery of ads to your device and to verify
      click-throughs and/or installs; (ii) provide you with more relevant ads about our Services (for example, to
      present you with an offer for one of our games you might enjoy); (iii) enable offer walls, which allow you to
      choose from various rewarded ad or market research offers; (iv) track results and measure the effectiveness of
      ads; and (iv) improve the accuracy of their targeting and measurement systems. We recommend that you review our
      advertising partners' privacy policies for more information, further details of which are set out below:

      You can learn more about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection
      and use of your information by visiting the websites for the 
Network Advertising Initiative
 and
      the 
Digital Advertising Alliance

      and the webpages for 
Facebook's ad preferences tool
 and 
privacy policy
. Similarly, you can learn
      about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings
      and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device. For more information about how to change these
      settings go to:

      Please note: adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive
      advertisements, it only means the ads you do see will be less relevant to your interests. Our advertising partners
      will also still use your device’s advertising ID to serve you with ads that may be less relevant to you; for
      example, we may use this for frequency capping (in other words, to control the maximum number of times you see the
      same ad from us). You may also reset the Advertising ID associated with your device by following instructions
      provided by your device manufacturer or operating system developer.
    


C. Analytics Technologies


We use our own game servers and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our
      Services, your computer or device and the health of our Services. 


For instance, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre
      Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), on our Services. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking
      technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Services, compile reports on the Services’
      activity
      , and provide other services related to our Services’ activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may
      collect information such as your IP address, time of visit and whether you are a return visitor. The Services do
      not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google
      Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies. To learn
      more about Google’s 
partner services
 and to learn
      how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google,
      click 
here
.
    


For our mobile apps and games on iOS and Android, we use the services of Adjust GmbH (Saarbrücker Str. 37a, 10405
      Berlin, Germany). We use the Adjust SDK (Software Development Kit) which is an analytics service that provides us
      the ability to obtain and collect statistical data on the usage of our games and apps so that we can better
      understand how our users are using our games and apps. For this purpose, Adjust processes mobile identifiers such
      as the IDFA, GAID or similar mobile identifiers. Adjust's privacy policy is available 
here
.


Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because there is not yet a common understanding
      of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to ""Do Not Track"" signals. However, we
      provide you with the ability to opt-out of the use of tracking technologies to send you interest-based advertising
      as explained above.

Under the CCPA, California residents have the following rights:

 You have the right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have
        collected, used and disclosed over the past 12 months, and information about our data practices;

 You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that
        we have collected from you;


Right to Non-Discrimination:
 We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.

 You have the right to be notified of any financial
        incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be

        this time. 






California law also permits you to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your personal
      information by us and our related companies to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We
      do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

      respond to ""Do Not Track"" signals. However, we provide you with the ability to opt-out of the use of tracking
      technologies to send you interest-based advertising as explained above.

      ID.


Under the CCPA, you may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these
      requests on your behalf. We may request that your authorized agent have written permission from you to make
      requests on your behalf and may need to verify your authorized agent’s identity.

What Information
We Have &
Where We Get It
When you create an account and buy tickets.
 
When you create an account, buy a ticket, register for a presale or have a ticket transferred to you by a friend, we will collect information directly from you. Depending on the service we are providing, this may include your contact and billing information, such as your name, street address, zip or post code, email, phone number and credit card.
When you buy tickets from third parties.
 
Where you buy tickets from third-party e-commerce sites, the third party will send us information such as your contact and billing information and information about your ticket purchase for us to allocate tickets to you.
When using our websites and apps.
 When you use our websites or apps, we may use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons and technology like GPS and Wi-Fi to passively collect data about you, such as the browser and device you're using, your IP address, your location, the site you came from, what you did and didn't use our site/app for, or the site you visit when you leave us. For more information on how we collect this information, see our 
Cookie Policy
When you contact our fan experience and customer support teams.
 
When you contact our Customer Services teams with a query or provide us with feedback, we record that interaction for evidentiary purposes and to provide support related to your query.
When you use social media and online public forums.
 
When you use a social media feature within our website or apps, post to social media platforms, or post on a public space or on one of our websites, the social media site may provide us with some information about you.
When you book accessible tickets.
 
If you have accessibility requirements, we want to make sure you have the best experience when attending events. To do this, we need to collect details of your requirements. We only do this once, with your requirements then on record for the next time you come back to purchase an accessible ticket.
When you sell a ticket on Ticketmaster.
 
As we are transferring money to you, we need to collect information such as a valid ID as part of our Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Once your identity has been verified, we securely delete this information. We may also collect information from you when you use our services as a seller, including additional identification data such as tax identification numbers.
Geodemographic data.
 We might collect or use suppliers such as advertising and marketing partners who collate geodemographic data such as age range, gender, or information about events you like or products you buy, which assists us in better personalising our services to you. If you’d prefer that we do not do this, see the 
‘Your Rights & Choices’
 section below.
Fan images and CCTV.
 When attending an event at a venue or festival we collect your image and likeness. This might be through CCTV cameras or videographers, photographers on-site. This is primarily collected for the safety and security of our fans; however, we sometimes use these images in our marketing or social media posts. If you wish to object to images being used for marketing visit the 
‘Your Rights & Choices’
 section below.
Onsite safeguarding when attending an event.
 
To provide a safe and secure event site we may process personal information to be able to enforce appropriate access management, confirm a person’s purpose for being onsite, or for any issues that may arise. As part of our safeguarding policies and procedures, we process personal information about incidents and visitor well-being.
Information used for health/safety purposes.
 
We may collect information from ticket purchasers and attendees for compliance purposes related to infectious disease to the extent required under applicable law. This information may include names, contact details, seat locations, along with entry and exit times.
In situations where a third party for an event organizer requires the collection of health information (such as test results), please refer to their privacy policy and terms to understand how your data was collected and used.
How We Use Your
Information & Why
This section explains how we use your information and the legal grounds/purposes for which we use it.
1.
For the performance of our contract with you
When you make purchases.
 
We use your information when you enter a contract or transaction with us (for example to buy merchandise or a ticket) so we can:
process your order
send you customer service emails including booking confirmations and event reminders
take payment
provide you with customer support.
Event Partner(s).
 
To share with Event Partner(s) who provide services for the event such as the Promoter or Venue to enable them to run the event, allocate seating or notify you if there has been a change to the event or provide important event information.
Verified Fan.
 Some of our events have Verified Fan presale. If you enter, we process your data to profile you to limit fraudulent ticket purchases. You don’t have to enter Verified Fan and if you are rejected, it won’t stop you from purchasing tickets at a later date. For full FAQs around how your data is used during the Verified Fan process see our Verified Fan FAQ’s fo 
North America
 or 
International
Contest, Competitions and Referrals.
 
We may use your information to confirm your registration for an event or contest. You may give us your friend's information, for example via our referral service to tell a friend about our website or to purchase a gift card. We will only use your friend's information to provide services you requested. Your friend may contact us to ask us to delete their information.
2.
For our legitimate business interests
Marketing.
 To contact you with information or offers regarding upcoming events, products or services (applicable to markets that rely on legitimate interest) this may be via email, via push and web notifications, via SMS, or social media platforms. You can change your marketing preferences at any time, see 
Your Rights & Choices
 section below.
Advertising & cookies.
 To deliver tailored advertising and marketing communications on our websites and apps depending on your market. (see our 
Cookie Policy
 for more information).
Market research & fan feedback.
 
To conduct market research and analysis which helps improve and customise our products and services and to contact you with satisfaction surveys, or to participate in user research (such as focus groups). We include an unsubscribe option for this kind of contact should you no longer wish to receive them.
Personalisation.
 
To make sure our messages and website are relevant to you (depending on your market). For example, when you ‘favourite’ certain artists and genres, purchase tickets, attend shows with friends and sign up for presales, we will inform you about similar events we think you might be interested in. We create a user profile with the information we have and how you use our services. By turning personalisation off you won’t get any personal recommendations and any newsletters you’ve subscribed to will be generic (although if you’ve asked to receive alerts about specific artists or venues, you’ll still receive these).
We will still perform profiling activities where we need to so we can deliver our services to you, for example for fraud screening purposes and where you specifically request we do so such as for a Verified Fan Presale.
3.
For our overriding legitimate business interests
To prevent or detect unlawful behaviour, to protect or enforce our legal rights or as otherwise permitted by law.
 
For example, making sure tickets get into the hands of real fans. As such, we may use your information to prevent ticket touting, misuse of our intellectual property (e.g. our or our Event Partner's brands), fraud, or other crimes.
Site Protection.
 This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprises and Google 
Privacy Policy
 and 
 Terms of Service 
apply.

How we use personal data
How we use personal data
mainhowweusepersonaldatamodule
Summary
Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:
Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.
Improve and develop our products.
Personalize our products and make recommendations.
Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.
We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.
In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.
Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, to build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including artificial intelligence or AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For instance, 
with your permission and for the purpose of improving our speech recognition technologies
, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify. This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.

We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.
For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products). For example, Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law. For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.
Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, to build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including artificial intelligence or AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For instance, 
with your permission and for the purpose of improving our speech recognition technologies
, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify. This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.

    When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the 
Reasons we share personal data
 section of this privacy statement. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the 
Where we store and process personal data
 section of this privacy statement.

More on the purposes of processing:
Provide our products
. We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.
    
Product improvement
. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.
    
Personalization
. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.
    
Product activation
. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation.
    
Product development
. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.
    
Customer support
. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents.
    
Help secure and troubleshoot
. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.
    
Safety
. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. 
In accordance with European Union Regulation (EU) 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 5(1) and 6(1) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery (known as a “hash set”), in a process called “hash matching”. Microsoft obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement authorities.
Updates
. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates.
    
Promotional communications
. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the 
How to access and control your personal data

        section of this privacy statement.
    
Relevant offers
. Microsoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to  predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.
    
Advertising
. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties (Microsoft properties), and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our Microsoft properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the  
Advertising
 section of this privacy statement.
    
Prize promotions and events
. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.
    
Transacting commerce
. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.
    
Reporting and business operations
. We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.
    
Protecting rights and property
. We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.
    
Legal compliance
. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.
    
Research.
 With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard individuals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes.
    
Reasons we share personal data
Reasons we share personal data
mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule
Summary
We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.
Please note that, as defined under certain U.S. state data privacy laws, “sharing” also relates to providing personal data to third parties for personalized advertising purposes. Please see the 
U.S. State Data Privacy
 section below and our 
U.S. State Data Privacy Laws Notice
 for more information.
Full text
We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on OneDrive, or link accounts with another service. If you use a Microsoft product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access Microsoft products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. Additionally, when you save a payment method (such as a card) to your account that you and other Microsoft account holders use to make purchases from Microsoft or its affiliates, your purchase receipts may be shared with anyone else who uses and has access to the same payment method to make a purchase from Microsoft, including the payment method’s named accountholder. When you permit push notifications for Microsoft products or applications on a non-Windows device, the operating system of that device will process some personal data to provide push notifications.  Accordingly, Microsoft may send data to an external, third-party notification provider to deliver push notifications. Your device’s push notification services are governed by their own service-specific terms and privacy statements.
In addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
Finally, we will retain, access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to do any of the following:
Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies. 
Protect our customers, for example, to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.
Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.
Protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services—however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.
For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our 
Law Enforcement Requests Report
.
Please note that some of our products include links to or otherwise enable you to access products of third parties whose privacy practices differ from those of Microsoft. If you provide personal data to any of those products, your data is governed by their privacy policies.

Your communications preferences

    You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.

You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your

If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this
    
web form
. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.

Your advertising choices
To opt out of receiving personalized advertising from Microsoft, visit our 
opt-out page
. When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.
You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.
For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.
Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection. You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.
You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).
Browser-based controls 
When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features. For example:
Cookie controls
. You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the 
Cookies
 section of this privacy statement. 
Tracking protections
. You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge. This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add. 
Browser controls for ""Do Not Track.""
 Some browsers have incorporated ""Do Not Track"" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.

Our use of cookies and similar technologies
Microsoft uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the context or product, including:
Storing your preferences and settings
. We use cookies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. For example, depending on your settings, if you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft website, we store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. Saving your preferences with cookies, such as your preferred language, prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device. Similarly, in scenarios where we obtain your consent to place cookies on your device, we store your choice in a cookie.
Sign-in and authentication
. We use cookies to authenticate you. When you sign in to a website using your personal Microsoft account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.
Security
. We use cookies to process information that helps us secure our products, as well as detect fraud and abuse.
Storing information you provide to a website
. We use cookies to remember information you shared. When you provide information to Microsoft, such as when you add products to a shopping cart on Microsoft websites, we store the data in a cookie for the purpose of remembering the information.
Social media
. Some of our websites include social media cookies, including those that enable users who are signed in to the social media service to share content via that service.
Feedback
. Microsoft uses cookies to enable you to provide feedback on a website.
Interest-based advertising
. Microsoft uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described in the 
How to access and control your personal data
 section of this privacy statement.
Showing advertising
. Microsoft uses cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen, for example, so you do not see the same one repeatedly.
Analytics
. We use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products.
Performance
. Microsoft uses cookies to understand and improve how our products perform. For example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps us keep our websites remain up and running.
Where required, we obtain your consent prior to placing or using optional cookies that are not (i) strictly necessary to provide the website; or (ii) for the purpose of facilitating a communication. Please see the “How to Control Cookies” section below for more information.

Our use of web beacons and analytics services
Some Microsoft webpages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.
In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us to, for example, develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website. It also allows us to understand your activity on the website of a Microsoft partner in connection with your use of a Microsoft product or service.

    Finally, Microsoft products often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, or other products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by visiting any of the following sites:

Other similar technologies
In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or ""Flash cookies"") and Silverlight Application Storage.

Microsoft account
Microsoft account
mainmicrosoftaccountmodule
Summary
With a Microsoft account, you can sign in to Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favorites. Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalization and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features.
There are three types of Microsoft account:
When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a 
personal Microsoft account
.
When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a 
work or school account
.
When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a 
third-party account
.
If you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.

.
When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a 
third-party account
.
Personal Microsoft accounts
. The data associated with your personal Microsoft account, and how that data is used, depends on how you use the account.
Creating your Microsoft account
. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some products, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign in to and use other Microsoft products without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address, and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft products. For example, people who know your display name, email address, or phone number can use it to search for you on Skype or Microsoft Teams for personal use and send you an invite to connect with them. Note that if you use a work or school email address to create a personal Microsoft account, your employer or school may gain access to your data. In some cases, you will need to change the email address to a personal email address in order to continue accessing consumer-oriented products (such as the Xbox network).
Signing in to Microsoft account
. When you sign in to your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the product you signed in to, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.
Signing in to Microsoft products
. Signing in to your account enables improved personalization, provides seamless and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to access and use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other enhanced features and settings. For example, when you sign in, Microsoft makes information saved to your account available across Microsoft products so important things are right where you need them. When you sign in to your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you in to products that use Microsoft account when you access those products on that device. When you are signed in, some products will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft products, including in your communications, social interactions, and public posts. 
Learn more about your Microsoft account, your data, and your choices
.
Signing in to third-party products
. If you sign in to a third-party product with your Microsoft account, you will share data with the third party in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy. The third party will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and information that describes whether your account has been deactivated. If you share your profile data, the third party can display your name or user name and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) when you are signed in to that third-party product. If you chose to make payments to third-party merchants using your Microsoft account, Microsoft will pass information stored in your Microsoft account to the third party or its vendors (e.g., payment processors) as necessary to process your payment and fulfill your order (such as name, credit card number, billing and shipping addresses, and relevant contact information). The third party can use or share the data it receives when you sign in or make a purchase according to its own practices and policies. 
You should carefully review the privacy statement for each product you sign in to and each merchant you purchase from to determine how it will use the data it collects
.
Work or school accounts
. The data associated with a work or school account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.
If your employer or school uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage the account it provides you, you can use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products, such as Microsoft 365 and Office 365, and third-party products provided to you by your organization. If required by your organization, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. And, if allowed by your organization, you may also use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft or third-party products that you acquire for yourself.
If you sign in to Microsoft products with a work or school account, note:
The owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, including data stored in products provided to you by your organization, and products you acquire by yourself.
Your use of the products is subject to your organization’s policies, if any. You should consider both your organization’s policies and whether you are comfortable enabling your organization to access your data before you choose to use your work or school account to sign in to products you acquire for yourself.
If you lose access to your work or school account (if you change employers, for example), you may lose access to products, including content associated with those products, you acquired on your own behalf if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.
Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organization, which may differ from those of Microsoft.
If your organization is administering your use of Microsoft products, please direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data subject rights, to your administrator. See also the 
Notice to end users
 section of this privacy statement.
If you are uncertain whether your account is a work or school account, please contact your organization.
Third-party accounts
. The data associated with a third-party Microsoft account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account. Your service provider has control over your account, including the ability to access or delete your account. 
You should carefully review the terms the third party provided you to understand what it can do with your account
.

Accessing and deleting child data.
 For Microsoft products and services that require parental consent, a parent can view and delete certain data belonging to their child from the parent’s 
privacy dashboard
: browsing history, search history, location activity, media activity, apps and service activity, and product and service performance data. To delete this data, a parent can sign in to their 
privacy dashboard
 and manage their child’s activities. Please note that a parent’s ability to access and/or delete a child’s personal information on their privacy dashboard will vary depending on the laws where you are located.
Additionally, a parent can contact our 
privacy support team
 through the 
privacy support form
 and, following authentication, request that the data types on the privacy dashboard together with the following data be deleted: software, setup, and inventory; device connectivity and configuration; feedback and ratings; fitness and activity; support content; support interactions; and environmental sensor. We process authenticated deletion requests within 30 days of receipt.
Please note that content like emails, contacts, and chats are accessible through in-product experiences. You can find more information about data you are able to control within Microsoft products by visiting our 
Privacy Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
.
If your child’s account is not a part of your Microsoft family group and you do not have access to your child’s activity on your privacy dashboard, then you need to submit a request related to your child’s data through the 
privacy support form
. The privacy team will ask for account verification before fulfilling the request.
To delete all of your child’s personal information, you must request deletion of the child’s account through the 
close your account form
. This link will prompt you to sign in with your child’s account credentials. Check that the page shows the correct Microsoft account, and then follow the instructions to request that your child’s account be deleted. 
Learn more about how to close a Microsoft account
.

After you submit the request to close your child’s account, we will wait 60 days before permanently deleting the account in case you change your mind or need to access something on the account before it is permanently closed and deleted. During the waiting period, the account is marked for closure and permanent deletion, but it still exists. If you want to reopen your child’s Microsoft account, just sign in again within that 60-day period. We will cancel the account closure, and the account will be reinstated.
What is Xbox?
 Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft. Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and enables online experiences crossing multiple platforms. This network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.
When users sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on an Xbox console, we assign a unique identifier to their device. For instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system they are using.
Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.
Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile
. You as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old or as otherwise specified by your jurisdiction. With your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network. During the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group. We collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security. If your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.
We collect limited information about children, including name, birthdate, email address, and region. When you sign your child up for an Xbox profile, they get a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you create your child’s Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharing information based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network. Your child’s privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.
Data we collect
. We collect information about your child’s use of Xbox services, games, apps, and devices including:
When they sign in and sign out of Xbox, purchase history, and content they obtain.
Which games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, play time per game, and other play statistics.
Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and network connection, including any software or hardware errors.
Content they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.
Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.
If your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.
Xbox diagnostic data
. If your child uses Xbox console, Xbox will send required data to Microsoft. Required data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.
Game captures
. Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play. Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your child’s in-game character and gamertag during that session. If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your child’s privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.
Captioning
. During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text. If a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it. This data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the 
Community Standards for Xbox
.
Data use
. Microsoft uses the data we collect to improve gaming products and experiences— making it safer and more fun over time. Data we collect also enables us to provide your child with curated experiences. This includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.
Xbox data viewable by others
. When your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence (which can be set to “appear offline” or “blocked”), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network. Depending on how you set your child’s Xbox safety settings, they might share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network.
Safety
. In order to help make the Xbox network a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we may collect and review voice, text, images, videos and in-game content (such as game clips your child uploads, conversations they have, and things they post in clubs and games).
Anti-cheat and fraud prevention
. Providing a fair gameplay environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity when your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device. In order to detect and prevent fraud and cheating, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention tools, applications, and other technologies. Such technologies may create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) using certain information collected from their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, and how they use that device. This can include information about the browser, device, activities, game identifiers, and operating system.
Xbox data shared with game and apps publishers
. When your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product. This data may include: your child’s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child’s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child’s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.
Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies. You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child’s data. For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services. You may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.

Data Sharing with Games and Apps
.
To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed. Some publisher access to your child’s data may be revoked at

Kinect
. The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control game play. For example:
        
If you choose, the camera can be used to sign in to the Xbox network automatically using facial recognition. This data stays on the console, is not shared with anyone, and can be deleted at any time.
For game play, Kinect will map distances between the joints on your child’s body to create a stick figure representation to enable play.
The Kinect microphone can enable voice chat between players during play. The microphone also enables voice commands for control of the console, game, or app, or to enter search terms.
The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as Skype.

Microsoft Corporation has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Microsoft Corporation has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. In the context of an onward transfer, Microsoft Corporation has responsibility for the processing of personal data it receives under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. Microsoft Corporation remains liable under the DPF if our agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF, unless Microsoft Corporation can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please

Our retention of personal data
Our retention of personal data
mainOurretentionofpersonaldatamodule
Summary
Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.
Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:
Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?
 Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox. In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion). (Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)
Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?
 If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.
Is the personal data of a sensitive type?
 If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.
Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?
 For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.
Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?
 If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.
Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?
 Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.

Advertising
Advertising
mainadvertisingmodule
Summary
Advertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use other data, detailed below, for advertising on our Microsoft properties and on third-party properties. For example:  
Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as 
Microsoft.com
, Microsoft Start, and Bing.
When the advertising ID is enabled in Windows as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.
We may share data we collect with internal and external partners, such as Xandr, Yahoo, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products and their products are more relevant and valuable to you.
Advertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases, and visits; we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads.
The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view. For example, if you view content on Microsoft Start about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars; if you search “pizza places in Seattle” on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in Seattle.
The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our products and sites, and the information we collect about you from the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners. We refer to these ads as ""personalized advertising"" in this statement. For example, if you view gaming content on 
xbox.com
, you may see offers for games on Microsoft Start. To provide personalized advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites. If you opt out of receiving personalized advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.
We may use information about you to serve you with personalized advertising when you use Microsoft services. If you are logged in with your Microsoft account and have consented to allow Microsoft Edge to use your online activity for personalized advertising, you will see offers for products and services based on your online activity while using Microsoft Edge. To configure your privacy settings for Edge, go to Microsoft Edge > Settings > Privacy and Services. To configure your privacy and ad settings for your Microsoft account with respect to your online activity across browsers, including Microsoft Edge, or when visiting third-party websites or apps, go to your dashboard at 
privacy.microsoft.com
.

Summary
Speech recognition technologies are integrated into many Microsoft products and services.

With your permission, Microsoft employees and vendors working on behalf of Microsoft, will be able to review snippets of your voice data or voice clips in order to build and improve our speech recognition technologies. These improvements allow us to build better voice-enabled capabilities that benefit users across all our consumer and enterprise products and services. Prior to employee or vendor review of voice data, we protect users’ privacy by taking steps to de-identify the data, requiring non-disclosure agreements with relevant vendors and their employees, and requiring that employees and vendors meet high privacy standards.

Summary
To provide the Enterprise Online Services, Microsoft uses data you provide (including Customer Data, Personal Data, Administrator Data, Payment Data, and Support Data) and data Microsoft collects or generates associated with your use of the Enterprise Online Services. We process data as described in the

Summary
Enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances collect data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences. The data we collect depends on the features you use, as well as your configuration and settings, but it is generally limited to device and usage data. Customers have choices about the data they provide. Here are examples of the data we collect:
During installation or when you upgrade an enterprise and developer software, we may collect device and usage data to learn whether you experience any difficulties.
When you use enterprise software or enterprise appliances, we may collect device and usage data to learn about your operating environment to improve security features.
When you experience a crash using enterprise software or enterprise appliances, you may choose to send Microsoft an error report to help us diagnose the problem and deliver customer support.
Microsoft uses the data we collect from enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances to provide and improve our products, to deliver customer support, to activate the product, to communicate with you, and to operate our business.
 Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management platform and includes products that can be installed separately (such as SQL Server Management Studio). For detailed information about what data we collect, how we use it, and how to manage your privacy options, visit the 
SQL Server privacy page
. If you work in an organization, your administrator can set certain telemetry settings in SQL Server via Group Policy.
HoloLens
. HoloLens headsets are self-contained Windows computers with Wi-Fi connectivity that enable a mixed reality experience for apps and solutions. Microsoft collects diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows running on HoloLens up to date, secure, and operating properly.

.
HoloLens also processes and collects data related to the HoloLens experience and device, which include cameras, microphones, and infrared sensors that enable motions and voice to navigate.
If you choose, cameras can be used to sign you in automatically using your iris. To do this, HoloLens takes an image of your iris and measures distances between key points to create and store a numeric value that represents only you. This data stays on the HoloLens and is not shared with anyone, and you can choose to delete this data from your HoloLens at any time.
HoloLens also detects hand gestures intended for system interactions (such as menu navigation, pan/zoom, and scroll). This data is processed on your HoloLens device and is not stored.
HoloLens derives tracking points based on your environment which allows it to understand surfaces in space and allows you to place digital assets on them. There are no images associated with this environmental data and it is stored locally on the HoloLens device. You can choose to delete this data from your HoloLens at any time.
The headset's microphones enable voice commands for navigation, controlling apps, or to enter search terms.

Microsoft 365 and Office
Microsoft 365 and Office
mainofficeservicesmodule
Summary
Microsoft 365, previous versions called Office 365, is a collection of subscription productivity services and applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, among others. Office is the one-time purchase version of these applications available on PC or Mac. Both Microsoft 365 and Office are comprised of client software applications and connected online services (or web apps in the case of Microsoft 365 for the web) that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences. For more details about Outlook, see the 
Outlook
 section of this privacy statement.  

Various cloud-based Microsoft 365 services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing and Cortana, and third-party connected products. If you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services. You can access the privacy controls within your Microsoft 365 and Office apps. For more information, see 
Account Privacy Settings
.
Office Roaming Service
. The Office Roaming Service helps keep your settings, including your privacy settings, up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365 or Office apps. When you sign in to your apps with either your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the service syncs some of your customized settings to Microsoft servers. For example, the service syncs a list of most recently used documents or the last location viewed within a document. When you sign in to another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. When you sign out of your apps, the service removes your settings from your device. Any changes you make to your customized settings are sent to Microsoft servers.
Updates from Microsoft
. Microsoft uses services such as Click-to-Run, Microsoft AutoUpdate (for Mac), or Microsoft Update (for some versions of Office) to provide you with security and other important updates.
These services can automatically detect the availability of online updates for Microsoft 365 or Office apps on your device and download and install them automatically.
Diagnostic Data
. Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep your Microsoft 365 or Office apps secure and up to date; (ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems; and (iii) make product improvements. This data does not include a user’s name or email address, the content of the user’s files, or information about apps unrelated to Microsoft 365 or Office. Users have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional.
Required
. The minimum data necessary to help keep apps secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device it’s installed on.
Optional
. Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.
See 
Diagnostic Data
 for more information.
Connected Experiences
. Microsoft 365 continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services. A subset of these connected experiences is also available in Office. If you choose to use connected experiences, required service data will be collected to help keep these connected experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected. See below for additional information about required service data.
Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences. There are two types of connected experiences.
Experiences that analyze your content
. Experiences that use your file content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.
Experiences that download online content
. Experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. For example, templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.
You can access the privacy controls within your Microsoft 365 and Office client apps. These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences. For example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content. Turning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage. But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below. These controls are not available when using Microsoft 365 for the web, since you will already be cloud-connected. For more information about accessing these controls, see 
Account Privacy Settings.
If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.
Essential services
. There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 and Office functions and cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential. Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured. See 
Essential Services
 for more information.
Required service data for connected experiences
. As you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience. This data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences. We refer to this data as required service data.
Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. If you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience. Your text and the translation are not stored by our service. Required service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Microsoft 365 or Office app.

Required service data

Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers.
Certain Family Safety features, such as Location Sharing, Drive Safety, Share Drives, Places, and Location Alerts will use your location information when enabled. When you have enabled Location Sharing, for instance, your device will upload location data to the cloud and share it with others in your family group. Microsoft retains only your last known location as part of the Location Sharing feature (each new location replaces the previous one). When you enable Drive Safety, your location will be used to record your drive habits such as whether you are driving within the speed limits, if you’re using your phone while driving, and if you accelerate or brake suddenly. These reports will be uploaded to the cloud, and you can choose to share your drive reports with your family group. You can turn off these location features at any time in the Family Safety settings. You can manage your device’s location data at the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard.

Microsoft Teams
Microsoft Teams
mainteamsmodule
Summary
This section applies to the consumer offering of Teams; if you are using Teams with a school or work account, see the 
Enterprise and developer products
 of this privacy statement.
Teams is an all-in-one collaboration and communication hub. Teams lets you stay organised and connected across your entire life. Teams allows you to call people with voice or video calling.  Teams allows you to easily find people, files, photos, conversations, tasks, and calendars in one convenient and secure place.  Teams allows you to store confidential information like passwords, rewards numbers, or login information and share it with others within Teams. With your consent, you can share your location with friends and family.
As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects data about the usage of the features as well as information about your communications, including the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the communication. Microsoft may share this information with Enterprise customers when you interact through meetings and chats with end users who are using their school or work account. For instance, if you engage in a Teams chat with a user who is using Teams associated with their school account, Microsoft may share your information with that user's school as part of providing the Teams service.
Teams profile
. Your Teams profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account. To enable other people to find you on Teams (or products that interact with Teams for personal use, including Teams for enterprise) your display name and picture are visible to other users on Teams that have your contact information. Your Teams profile may be visible to Enterprise customers and their end users when you engage with an end user of an organization in chats and meetings. 
Teams contacts
. With your permission, Teams will sync your device, Outlook, and Skype contacts periodically and check for other Teams users that match contacts in your device, Outlook, or Skype address books. You are always in control of your contacts and can stop syncing at any time. If you choose to stop syncing your device, Outlook, or Skype contacts, or you are inactive on your device, any contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization process will be deleted from Teams. If you wish to invite any of your device, Outlook, or Skype contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or Microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via SMS or email for invitations to group conversations. You can block users if you do not want to receive their communications; additionally, you can report a concern to Microsoft.
Notice to non-user contacts.
 If your information appears in the device, Outlook, or Skype address books of a Teams user who chooses to sync their device, Outlook, or Skype contacts with their Teams contacts, Microsoft may process your data in order to determine whether you are a current Teams user and to allow Teams users to invite you to the service, including via SMS and email. As long as the Teams user continues to be active on Teams on their device and continues to enable contact syncing with the applicable device or service, your information will be stored on our servers and we will periodically process your information as a part of the Teams user’s contact syncing experience to check whether you have subsequently joined Teams.

Learn more about how we process your information in connection with the contact syncing feature offered to Teams users

If you do choose to join Teams, you will appear as a suggested new Teams contact for any Teams users with your information in their device, Outlook, or Skype address books. As a Teams user, you will be able to block other Teams users if you do not want to receive their communications; additionally, you can report a concern to Microsoft.
Third-party contacts.
 You can also choose to sync contacts from third-party providers. If you choose to unsync your third-party contacts on Teams, all third-party contacts are deleted from Teams. If you gave your consent to use those third-party contacts on other Microsoft apps and services, these contacts will still be available to those other Microsoft apps and services.
You can remove third-party contacts from all Microsoft apps and services by removing third-party accounts from Teams. Please note that removing a third-party account from Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services that also use that third-party account.
Teams calendar.
 You can also choose to sync your Teams calendar with calendars from third-party providers. You can stop syncing your Teams calendar anytime by removing a third-party account from Teams. If you have consented to use third-party data on other Microsoft apps and services, please note that removing this third-party account data in Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services.

. You can share your static or live location with individuals or groups within Teams.  You are in control and can stop sharing at any time.  Sharing location for children is permitted with parental consent and in groups where an adult from the Microsoft family group is present.
Push notifications
. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Teams has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.
If you do not want to use the notification services for incoming Teams calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found on your device.

You should direct your privacy inquiries related to your data shared through chats and meetings with an organization’s end users, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to the organization’s administrator. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.
OneDrive
OneDrive
mainonedrivemodule
Summary
OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.
When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.
When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.
When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.
When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.
Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.
Outlook
Outlook
mainoutlookmodule
Summary
Outlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.
Outlook.com
. Outlook.com is the primary consumer email service from Microsoft and includes email accounts with addresses that end in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com. Outlook.com provides features that let you connect with your friends on social networks. You will need to create a Microsoft account to use Outlook.com.
When you delete an email or item from a mailbox in Outlook.com, the item generally goes into your Deleted Items folder where it remains for approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes first. When the Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion, unless we are legally required to retain the data for longer.
Outlook applications
. Outlook client applications are software you install on your device that permits you to manage email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other data from email, file storage, and other services, like Exchange Online or Outlook.com, or servers, like Microsoft Exchange. You can use multiple accounts from different providers, including third-party providers, with Outlook applications.
To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.
When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device. If you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application. If you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.
If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.
To learn more about the data the Outlook applications collect and process, please see the

Push notifications
. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service. If you do not want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.

Translation features
. When you use Skype’s translation features, Skype collects and uses your conversation to provide the translation service. With your permission, your data may be used to help improve Microsoft products and services.

This data may include manual transcription of your voice clips. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see 
Speech recognition technologies
.

Recording features
. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio / video call. The recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred. 
You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.
 Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.

Skype bots
. Bots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more. Depending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot. Please review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot. You can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with. Prior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.

Captioning

Bing search now includes an AI-enhanced web search functionality, Bing Chat, which supports users by providing relevant search results, reviewing and summarizing from across the web, refining research queries through the chat experience, and sparking creativity by helping users create content. Bing Chat’s use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bing’s core web search offering as described in this section. More information about the new Bing experience is available at 
The New Bing: Our approach to Responsible AI
.

Search suggestions
. For the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft. This allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches. To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to 
Bing Settings
. There are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser. Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in the search box in Windows 10 and Windows 11. If you choose, you can always hide the search box or icon on the taskbar.

Bing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar
. If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.

Retention and de-identification
. We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.

Personalization through Microsoft account
. Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit 
Bing Settings
 to manage your personalization settings, or the 
Microsoft privacy dashboard
 to manage your data.

Managing search history
. When you’re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search and chat history on the 
Microsoft privacy dashboard
. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Bing chat are also remembered as “Recent activity”. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it. Your Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user. However, if you are using Bing Chat for Enterprise while signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account, your Bing Chat for Enterprise conversations will not be saved or stored.

Third-party services that use Bing
. You may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier). This data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.

Data passed to destination website
. When you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit—such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case, 
https://www.bing.com/
).

Sharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties
. We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties. Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.

mainmsedgemodule
Summary
Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (""standard device data"") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' or online services’ web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Certain features in Microsoft Edge, such as when you open a new tab in the browser, connect you to Microsoft Start Content and your experiences with such content is covered by the Microsoft Start section of this privacy statement. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.
Microsoft Edge for Windows, Linux, and macOS
. Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows 10 and later and is also available on other supported versions of Windows and macOS.
Data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Clear Browsing History.
Microsoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:
Settings and More
. Allows you to manage your favorites, downloads, history, extensions, and collections.
Collections
. Allows you to collect text, images, videos, and other content in a note page in your browser. When you drag content into your collection, it is cached on your device and can be deleted through your collection.
Website Pin to Taskbar
. Allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.
Microsoft collects data necessary to provide features you request in Microsoft Edge. When signed into Microsoft Edge using your Microsoft personal account or work or school account, Microsoft Edge will sync your browser data saved on your device across other signed-in devices. You may choose which browser data to sync, including your favorites, browsing history, extensions and associated data, settings, open tabs, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), passwords, payment information, and other data types as they become available. If you choose to sync extensions that you acquired from third-party web stores, a copy of those extensions will be downloaded directly from those web stores on your synced device(s). If you have turned on Password Monitor, your saved credentials are hashed, encrypted and sent to Microsoft’s Password Monitor service to warn you if your credentials were detected as part of a malicious attack or a breach.  Microsoft does not retain this data after the check is complete. You can disable or configure syncing in the Microsoft Edge settings.
When you sign into Microsoft Edge with your Microsoft personal account or work or school account, Microsoft Edge will store your account’s privacy preferences. Microsoft Edge will use the stored preferences to migrate your account’s privacy choices across your signed-in devices, including during Windows device set up or when you sign into Microsoft Edge with your account on a new device.
Microsoft Edge’s 
Search and site suggestions

SwiftKey
SwiftKey
mainswiftkeymodule
Summary

    The Microsoft Swiftkey keyboard and related cloud-based services (collectively, the “SwiftKey Services”) process data about words you use and how you type and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you. We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions.


    SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model. This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style. The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey’s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered. The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites. The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data. SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below). When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data. We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products.


    The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account. If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup. When you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.


    You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving Microsoft products and services. Depending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing. These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see 
Speech recognition technologies
.


    If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, Microsoft will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base. This allows us to improve our basic models for individual languages. Language and typing data used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered out.


    You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data or voice clips for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings. You can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings. When you withdraw consent for SwiftKey to retain your personal data, all personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey Services will be deleted.


    You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you. You can disable these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.

Windows
Windows
mainwindowsmodule
Summary
Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files. For more information about data collection in Windows, see 
Data collection summary for Windows
. This statement discusses Windows 10 and Windows 11 and references to Windows in this section relate to those product versions. Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.
Activation
Activation
mainactivationmodule
Summary
When you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed. The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software. This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license. On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.
Activity history
Activity history
mainactivityhistorymodule
Summary
Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse. Your activity history is created when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge Legacy, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps and is stored locally on your device. If you've signed in to your device with a work or school account and give your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft. Once your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.
You can turn settings off or on for sending your activity history to Microsoft and storing activity history locally on your device, and you can also clear your device’s activity history at any time by going to

Advertising ID
Advertising ID
mainadvertisingidmodule
Summary
Windows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use for their own purposes, including providing relevant advertising in apps. When the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie. Thus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web. Microsoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting.
The advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier. You can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in the Windows settings app. If you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated. When a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy. 
Learn more about advertising ID in Windows
.
The advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites. Third-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies. Microsoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft products, both directly and by partnering with third-party ad providers. For more information on how Microsoft uses data for advertising, see the 
How we use personal data
 section of this statement.
Diagnostics
Diagnostics
maindiagnosticsmodule
Summary
Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the “Tailored experiences” setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to tailor Microsoft and third-party products and services for Windows to the customer’s needs. This data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns.
There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data:  Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data. Certain product documentation and other materials refer to Required diagnostic data as Basic diagnostic data and to Optional diagnostic data as Full diagnostic data.
If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage the account it provides to you and enrolls your device in the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration, Microsoft’s processing of diagnostic data in connection with Windows is governed by a contract between Microsoft and the organization. If an organization uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, Microsoft and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of your devices managed by the organization, and for other purposes of the organization.
Required diagnostic data
 includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. We collect the following Required diagnostic data:

        Device, connectivity, and configuration data:
        
Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.
Network capabilities and connection data such as the device’s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.
Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.
Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.
Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.
Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.
Whether updates complete successfully or fail.
Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.
Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device. For example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.
Optional diagnostic data
 includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health. Optional diagnostic data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users. When you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:
Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.
Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.  
App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input. 
Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer). 
Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred). Crash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.
Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data. Microsoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample). By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device. Instructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found in the Windows settings app under Diagnostics & feedback.
Specific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described. For example, to enable Microsoft to troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users’ computing experience or update a Windows device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously. For a current list of data types collected at 
Required diagnostic data
 and 
Optional diagnostic data
, see 
Windows Required (Basic level) diagnostic events and fields
 or 
Windows Optional (Full level) diagnostic data
. We provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services. They are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services. We may also share some aggregated, de-identified diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, with selected third parties. 
Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows
.
Inking and typing Recognition
. You also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data. If you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Microsoft customers. When Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you. It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary. 
Learn more about improving inking and typing in Windows
.
If you choose to turn on 
Tailored experiences
, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Required or Optional as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft experiences. If you have selected Required as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. If you have selected Optional, personalization is also based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device. However, we do not use information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Optional.
Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences. For example, to help you get the most out of your device, we may tell you about features you may not know about or that are new. If you are having a problem with your Windows device, you may be offered a solution. You may be offered a chance to customize your lock screen with pictures, or to be shown more pictures of the kind you like, or fewer of the ones you do not. If you stream movies in your browser, you may be recommended an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. Or, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, Windows may recommend you try OneDrive or purchase hardware to gain more space.

Windows location service
. Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device’s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely. When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. This de-identified location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see 
https://www.here.com/
) and Skyhook (see 
https://www.skyhook.com
) to improve the location services of the provider.
Windows services and features, apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device’s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so. Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device’s location. For information about certain Windows apps that use the device’s location, see the 
Windows apps
 section of this privacy statement.

    When an app or feature accesses the device’s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you’ve granted permission. We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one). Data about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history. You can clear your device's location history at any time in the Windows settings app.

In the Windows settings app, you can also view which apps have access to the device’s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device’s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device’s location. You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can’t detect a more exact location for your device.

    There are some exceptions to how your device’s location can be determined that are not directly managed by the location settings.	

Desktop apps are a specific type of app that won’t ask for separate permission to discover your device location information and won’t appear in the list that allows you to choose apps that can use your location. They can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store, downloaded from the internet, or installed with some type of media (such as a CD, DVD, or USB storage device). They’re opened using an .EXE, .MSI, or .DLL file, and they typically run on your device, unlike web-based apps (which run in the cloud).  
Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device’s location when the device’s location setting is off
.
Some web-based experiences or third-party apps that surface on Windows could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) or cloud-based location services to determine your device’s location with varying degrees of accuracy even when you’ve turned off the device location setting.

    In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings. If your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device’s location.

General Location
. If you turn on Location services, apps that cannot use your precise location may still have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.
Find my device
. The Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices. To enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled. This feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps. When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area.

.
Recording
. Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others. If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device. In some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly. 
Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.
 Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.

After onboarding, your session will last 15 minutes to enable you to transfer your Photos from your mobile device. To use this feature again, you will need to scan your QR code. Link to Windows does not collect your work or school account information or information about your Enterprise. In order to provide this service, Microsoft uses a cloud service to relay your files for the purpose of inserting the photos into web and desktop version of select Microsoft 365 apps, such as PowerPoint, Excel, and Word files.
Security and safety features
Security and safety features
mainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmodule
Summary
Device encryption
. Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology. When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.
Malicious Software Removal Tool
. The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (""malware"") and helps remove any infections found. When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device. During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device. If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.
Microsoft Family
. Parents can use Microsoft Family Safety to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device. Please carefully review the information at 
Microsoft Family Safety
 if choosing to create or join a family group. If you live in a region that requires permission to create an account to access Microsoft services, you may be prompted to request or give parental consent. If a user is under the statutory age in your region, during the registration process they will be prompted to request consent from a parent or guardian by entering an adult’s email. When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers.
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and Smart App Control
. Microsoft strives to help protect your device and passwords from unsafe apps, files, and web content.
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by identifying threats to you, your device, and your passwords. These threats might include potentially unsafe apps or web content that Microsoft Defender SmartScreen discovers while checking websites you visit, files you download, and apps you install and run. When Microsoft Defender SmartScreen checks web and app content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content. When additional analysis is needed to identify security threats, information about the suspicious website or app—such as content displayed, sounds played, and application memory—may be sent to Microsoft. This data will only be used for security purposes in detecting, protecting against, and responding to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, or other malicious, deceptive, or illegal activities. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in the Windows Security app.
Where supported, Smart App Control helps check software that is installed and runs on your device to determine if it is malicious, potentially unwanted, or poses other threats to you and your device. On a supported device, Smart App Control starts in evaluation mode and the data we collect for Microsoft Defender SmartScreen such as file name, a hash of the file’s contents, the download location, and the file’s digital certificates, is used to help determine whether your device is a good candidate to use Smart App Control for additional security protection. Smart App Control is not enabled and will not block during evaluation mode.  Some devices may not be good candidates if Smart App Control would otherwise get in the way and interfere with a user’s otherwise intended and legitimate tasks – for instance, developers who use a lot of unsigned files. If you are a good candidate for Smart App Control, then it will automatically be turned on, and will provide additional protection to your device beyond Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. Otherwise, Smart App Control will be unavailable and permanently turned off. If your device is unsupported or not a good candidate for Smart App Control, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will continue to help protect your device. When Smart App Control is enabled and identifies an app as malicious, potentially unwanted, or unknown and unsigned, it will block and notify you prior to opening, running, or installing the app. 
Learn more about Smart App Control
.
When either Microsoft Defender SmartScreen or Smart App Control checks a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file’s contents, the download location, and the file’s digital certificates.
Smart App Control can be turned on or off in the Windows Security app.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus
. Microsoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device. Microsoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device. If Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device. When Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection. If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent. You can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.
Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and Typing
Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and Typing
mainspeechinkingtypingmodule
Summary
Speech
. Microsoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.


    Turning on the Online speech recognition setting lets apps use Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition. Additionally, in Windows 10, the Online speech recognition setting enables your ability to use dictation within Windows.


    Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions. Both device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled. With both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies.


    When you use cloud-based speech recognition technologies from Microsoft, whether enabled by the Online speech recognition setting or when you interact with HoloLens or voice typing, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to provide the speech recognition service by creating a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data. Microsoft will not store, sample, or listen to your voice recordings without your permission. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see 
Speech recognition technologies
.


    You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft. However, Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition technologies provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition. When the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that do not rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition—like the live captions app, the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app—will still work and Microsoft won’t collect any voice data.


    You can turn off online speech recognition at any time. This will stop any apps that rely on the Online speech recognition setting from sending your voice data to Microsoft. If you are using a HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time. This will stop the device from listening for your voice input.

.

Voice Activation
. Windows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app—for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond when you say “Cortana.”

If you’ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows  will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords. Once a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer. The app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands. Each app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.
Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked. If enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device. When the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.

    You can turn off voice activation at any time. 
Learn more about voice activation in Windows
.


    Even when you’ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input. 
Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to access your microphone even with these settings turned off
.

Voice typing
. In Windows 11, dictation has been updated and renamed as voice typing. Voice typing may use both device-based and online speech recognition technologies to power its speech-to-text transcription service. You can also choose to contribute voice clips to help improve voice typing. If you choose not to contribute voice clips, you can still use voice typing. You can change your selection anytime in the voice typing settings. Microsoft will not store, sample, or listen to your voice recordings without your permission. 
 Learn more about Microsoft and your voice data
.

Voice access
. Windows enables everyone, including people with mobility disabilities, to control their PC and author text using their voice. For example, voice access supports scenarios like opening and switching between apps, browsing the web, and reading and authoring mail. Voice access leverages modern, on-device speech recognition to accurately recognize speech and is supported without an internet connection. 
Learn more about voice access
.
Inking & Typing Personalization
. Your typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you with a custom word list, better character recognition to help you type and write on your device, and text suggestions that appear as you type or write. 


    You can turn off inking & typing personalization at any time. This will delete your customer word list stored on your device. If you turn it back on, you’ll need to recreate your custom word list.

Web browsers—Microsoft Edge Legacy and Internet Explorer
mainwebbrowsersmodule
Summary
This section applies to legacy versions of Microsoft Edge (versions 44 and below). See the 
Microsoft Edge
 section of the Privacy Statement for information about non-legacy versions of Microsoft Edge.
Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows. Internet Explorer, the legacy browser from Microsoft, is also available in Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (""standard device data"") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.
Additionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History.
Microsoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:
Web note
. Allows you to create ink and text annotations on the webpages you visit, and clip, save, or share them.
Active reading
. Allows you to create and manage reading lists, including websites or documents.
Hub
. Allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area.
Website Pin to Taskbar
. Allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.
Some Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account. For instance, in Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites, reading lists, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), and may include data for extensions that you have installed. As an example, if you sync your Microsoft Edge reading list across devices, copies of the content you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for later viewing. You can disable syncing in Internet Explorer by going to 
Start
 > 
Settings
 > 
Accounts
 > 
Sync your settings
. (For more information, see the 
Sync settings
 section of this privacy statement.) You can also disable syncing of Microsoft Edge browser information by turning off the sync option in Microsoft Edge Settings.
Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer use your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search results. These features include:
Search suggestions
 in Internet Explorer automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to your default search provider (such as Bing) to offer search recommendations as you type each character. 
Search and site suggestions
 in Microsoft Edge automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to Bing (even if you have selected another default search provider) to offer search recommendations as you type each character.
You can turn off these features at any time. In order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer send your search queries, standard device information, and location (if you have location enabled) to your default search provider.

mainwindowsappsmodule
Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app
. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the 
Bing
 section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the 
Sync and backup settings
 section of this privacy statement.
Camera app
. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app
. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. 
Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping
.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app
. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app
. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app
. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows 
Location services
 section of this privacy statement.
Narrator
. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to 
Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links
 in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback.  If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions
. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content.  Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft.

Windows Media Player
Windows Media Player
mainwindowsmediaplayermodule
Summary
Windows Media Player allows you to play CDs, DVDs, and other digital content (such as WMA and MP3 files), rip CDs, and manage your media library. To enrich your experience when you play content in your library, Windows Media player displays related media information, such as album title, song titles, album art, artist, and composer. To augment your media information, Windows Media player will send a request to Microsoft which contains standard computer information, an identifier for the media content, and the media information already contained in your Windows Media Player library (including information you may have edited or entered yourself) so that Microsoft can recognize the track and then return additional information that is available.
Windows Media Player also allows you to play back content that is streamed to you over a network. To provide this service, it is necessary for Windows Media Player to communicate with a streaming media server. These servers are typically operated by non-Microsoft content providers. During playback of streaming media, Windows Media Player will send a log to the streaming media server or other web server(s) if the streaming media server requests it. The log includes such details as: connection time, IP address, operating system version, Windows Media Player version, Player identification number (Player ID), date, and protocol. To protect your privacy, Windows Media Player defaults to sending a Player ID that is different for each session.

Entertainment and Related Services power rich experiences and enable you to access a variety of content, applications and games.
Xbox
Xbox
mainxboxmodule
Summary
The Xbox network is the online gaming and entertainment service from Microsoft that consists of software and enables online experiences across different platforms. This service lets you find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.
When you sign up for an Xbox profile, we assign you a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you sign in on Xbox devices, apps, and services, the data we collect about your use is stored using these unique identifier(s).
Xbox consoles are devices you can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment. When you sign in to Xbox experiences—in apps or on a console—we also assign a unique identifier to your device. When your Xbox console is connected to the internet, for instance, and you sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system you’re using.
Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as the Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected.
Data we collect
 about your use of Xbox services, games, apps, and consoles includes:
When you sign in and sign out of Xbox, any purchases you make, and content you obtain.
Which games you play and apps you use, your game progress, achievements, play time per game, and other play statistics.
Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and your network connection, including any software or hardware errors.
Content you add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video you capture in games and apps.
Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections you make (friends you add and people who follow you) on the Xbox network.
If you use an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time you sign in to Xbox, even if you’ve been playing offline.
Xbox diagnostic data
. Diagnostic data has two categories: required and optional.
Required
. Xbox will send required data to Microsoft. The minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.
Optional
. Optional data is additional data that you choose to share with Microsoft. Optional data may include additional details about the operation, usage, and performance of your Xbox products and services, as well as enhanced error reporting.
Learn more at 
Manage settings for optional data sharing
.
Game captures
. Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play. Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your in-game character and gamertag during that session. If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat.
Captioning
. During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text. If a player activates this feature, all voice communication in the party is captioned for the player. Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it, as well as the other purposes described in this statement.
Data use
. Microsoft uses the data we collect to improve gaming products and experiences—making them safer and more fun over time.
Data we collect also enables us to provide you with curated experiences. This includes connecting you to games, content, and services, as well as presenting you with offers, discounts, and recommendations. To change your settings for purchase recommendations, visit 
Xbox online safety and privacy settings
 page.
Xbox data viewable by others
. Your gamertag, game and play statistics, achievements, presence (whether you are currently signed in to Xbox), content you share, and other data about your activity on Xbox can be seen by:
Other players signed in to Xbox.
Customers of third-party services you’ve linked your profile to, or
Other services associated with Xbox (including those of partner companies).
For example, your gamertag and scores that show on game leaderboards are considered public and cannot be hidden. For other data, you can adjust your privacy settings on consoles and at 
Xbox.com
 to limit or block what is shared with the public or with friends.

Xbox online safety and privacy settings
.
Xbox data shared with third parties including game and apps publishers
. When you use an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on your Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about your usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product. This data may include: your Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game, types of vehicles used in-game), your presence on the Xbox network, the time you spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs you belong to, official club memberships, and any content you create or submit in the game or app.
Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies. You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use the data. For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services. You may find their policies linked from game or app detail pages in the Microsoft Store.
Learn more at 
Data Sharing with Games and Apps
.
To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where you have installed them. Some publisher access to your data may be revoked at 
https://microsoft.com/consent
.
Children and family
. If you have kids who want to use the Xbox network, you can set up child and teen profiles for them once they have Microsoft accounts. Adult organizers in your Microsoft family group can change consent choices and online safety settings for child and teen profiles on

Safety
. In order to help make the Xbox network a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we may collect and review voice, text, images, videos and in-game content (such as game clips you upload, conversations you have, and things you post in clubs and games).
Anti-cheat and fraud prevention
. Providing a fair gameplay environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity when you use an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on your Xbox console, PC, or mobile device. In order to detect and prevent fraud and cheating, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention tools, applications, and other technologies. Such technologies may create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) using certain information collected from your Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, and how you use that device. This can include information about the browser, device, activities, game identifiers, and operating system.
Legacy
.
Xbox 360
. This Xbox console collects limited required diagnostic data to keep  your console functioning as expected while using a console connected to the Xbox network.
Kinect
. The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control gameplay. For example:
        
If you choose, the camera can be used to sign you in to the Xbox network automatically using facial recognition. This data stays on the console and is not shared with anyone, and you can choose to delete this data from your console at any time.
For game play, Kinect will map distances between your body's joints to create a stick figure representation of you that helps Kinect enable play.
The Kinect microphone can enable voice chat between players during play. The microphone also enables voice commands for control of the console, game, or app, or to enter search terms.
The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as Skype.

Microsoft Store
Microsoft Store
mainwindowsstoremodule
Summary
Microsoft Store is an online service, accessible via PC, the Xbox Console and the Xbox App, that allows you to browse, download, purchase, rate, and review applications and other digital content. It includes:
Apps and content for Windows devices such as phones, PCs, and tablets.
Games, subscriptions and other apps for Xbox consoles and other devices.
Products and apps for Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access, and Project (2013 versions or later).
We collect data about how you access and use Microsoft Store; the products you've viewed, purchased, or installed; the preferences you set for viewing apps in Microsoft Store; and any ratings, reviews, or problem reports you submit. Your Microsoft account is associated with your ratings and reviews; and if you write a review, the name and picture from your Microsoft account will be published with your review.
Permission for Microsoft Store apps
. Many apps you install from the Microsoft Store are designed to take advantage of specific hardware and software features of your device. An app's use of certain hardware and software features may give the app or its related service access to your data. For example, a photo editing app might access your device's camera to let you take a new photo or access photos or videos stored on your device for editing, and a restaurant guide might use your location to provide nearby recommendations. Information about the features that an app uses is provided on the app's product description page in Microsoft Store. Many of the features that Microsoft Store apps use can be turned on or off through your device’s privacy settings. In Windows, in many cases, you can choose which apps can use a particular feature. Go to 
Start > Settings > Privacy or Privacy & Security
, select the feature (for example, Calendar), and then select which app permissions are on or off. The lists of apps in Windows privacy settings that can use hardware and software features will not include ""Classic Windows"" applications, and these applications are not affected by these settings.
App updates
. Unless you have turned off automatic app updates in the relevant Microsoft Store settings or have acquired an app provided and updated by the app developer, Microsoft Store will automatically check for, download, and install app updates to verify that you have the latest versions. Updated apps might use different Windows hardware and software features from the previous versions, which could give them access to different data on your device. You will be prompted for consent if an updated app accesses certain features, such as location. You can also review the hardware and software features an app uses by viewing its product description page in Microsoft Store.
Each app's use of your data collected through any of these features is subject to the app developer's privacy policies. If an app available through Microsoft Store collects and uses any of your personal data, the app developer is required to provide a privacy policy, and a link to the privacy policy is available on the app's product description page in Microsoft Store.
Sideloaded apps and developer mode
. Developer features such as the ""developer mode"" setting are intended for development use only. If you enable developer features, your device may become unreliable or unusable, and expose you to security risks. Downloading or otherwise acquiring apps from sources other than Microsoft Store, also known as ""sideloading"" apps, may make your device and personal data more vulnerable to attack or unexpected use by apps. Windows policies, notifications, permissions, and other features intended to help protect your privacy when apps access your data may not function as described in this statement for sideloaded apps or when developer features are enabled.

Silverlight
Silverlight
mainsilverlightmodule
Summary
Microsoft Silverlight helps you to access and enjoy rich content on the Web. Silverlight enables websites and services to store data on your device. Other Silverlight features involve connecting to Microsoft to obtain updates, or to Microsoft or third-party servers to play protected digital content.
Silverlight Configuration tool
. You can make choices about these features in the Silverlight Configuration tool. To access the Silverlight Configuration tool, right click on content that is currently being displayed by Silverlight and select 
Silverlight
. You can also run the Silverlight Configuration tool directly. In Windows, for example, you can access the tool by searching for ""Microsoft Silverlight.""
Silverlight application storage
. Silverlight-based applications can store data files locally on your computer for a variety of purposes, including saving your custom settings, storing large files for graphically intensive features (such as games, maps, and images), and storing content that you create within certain applications. You can turn off or configure application storage in the Silverlight Configuration tool.
Silverlight updates
. Silverlight will periodically check a Microsoft server for updates to provide you with the latest features and improvements. A small file containing information about the latest Silverlight version will be downloaded to your computer and compared to your currently installed version. If a newer version is available, it will be downloaded and installed on your computer. You can turn off or configure updates in the Silverlight Configuration tool.
Digital Rights Management
. Silverlight uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to help protect the rights of content owners. If you access DRM-protected content (such as music or video) with Silverlight, it will request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet. In order to provide a seamless playback experience, you will not be prompted before Silverlight sends the request to the rights server. When requesting media usage rights, Silverlight will provide the rights server with an ID for the DRM-protected content file and basic data about your device, including data about the DRM components on your device such as their revision and security levels, and a unique identifier for your device.
DRM updates
. In some cases, accessing DRM-protected content will require an update to Silverlight or to the DRM components on your device. When you attempt to play content that requires a DRM update, Silverlight will send a request to a Microsoft server containing basic data about your device, including information about the DRM components on your computer such as their revision and security levels, troubleshooting data, and a unique identifier for your device. The Microsoft server uses this identifier to return a unique DRM update for your device, which will then be installed by Silverlight. You can turn off or configure DRM component updates on the 
Playback
 tab in the Silverlight Configuration tool.

choices
 about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo,

2. How We Use Your Data
















We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.




 








How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your 
settings
. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.
 
2.1 Services
















Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.




 








We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
 
Stay Connected
 
Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their 
settings
, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
 
We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
 
It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can 
choose
 whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
 
Visitors have 
choices
 about how we use their data.
 
Stay Informed
 
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your 
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a 
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were 
mentioned in the news
.
 
Career
 
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a 
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are 
interested
 in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
 
Productivity
 
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your 
settings
 allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.

2.2 Premium Services
















Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content through social

Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you 
opt-out
. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include 
TeamLink
 and 
Elevate
 (social promotion of content).
 
2.3 Communications
















We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.




 








We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication 
preferences

2.4 Advertising
















We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.




 








We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
 
 
Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers;
 
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
 
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, 
groups
 participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
 
Information from advertising 
partners
, vendors and 
publishers 
; and
 
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).
 
 
We will show you ads called 
sponsored content
 which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your 
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
 
Ad Choices
 
We adhere to 
self-regulatory principles
 for interest-based advertising and participate in industry 
opt-outs
 from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also 
opt-out
 specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, 
the setting is 
here
.
 
Info to Ad Providers
 
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.
 
2.5 Marketing
















We promote our Services to you and others.




 








In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
 
2.6 Developing Services and Research
















We develop our Services and conduct research




 








Service Development
 
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct 
research
 and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
 
Other Research
 
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these 
jobs
 and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under 
controls
 that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
 
Surveys
 
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may 
opt-out
 of survey invitations.

We use data to help you and fix problems.




 








We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
 
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
















We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.




 








We use your 
data
 to produce and share insights that do not identify you.

2.9 Security and Investigations
















We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.

3. How We Share Information
 
3.1 Our Services
















Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.




 








Profile
 
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your 
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our 
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their 
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
 
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
 
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
 
 
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your 
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
 
In a 
group
, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your 
settings
.
 
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages.
 
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
 
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your 
settings
 where applicable.
 
Subject to your 
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile.
 
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
 
















Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.




 








Enterprise Accounts
 
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
 
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
 
Subject to your 
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
 
3.2 Communication Archival
















Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.




 








Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
 
3.3 Others’ Services
















You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.




 








Subject to your 
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may 
revoke
 the link with such accounts.
 
Subject to your 
settings
, excerpts from your 
profile
 will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging, 
social media aggregators
, talent and lead managers). “Old” profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.
 
3.4 Related Services
















We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.




 








We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
 
3.5 Service Providers
















We may use others to help us with our Services.




 








We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.
 
3.6 Legal Disclosures
















We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.




 








It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our 
Data Request Guidelines
 and 
Transparency Report
.
 
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
















We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.




 








We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.














4. Your Choices & Obligations
 
4.1 Data Retention
















We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.




 








We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
 
4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data
















You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.

We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have 
restricted
 your account for breach of our 
Professional Community Policies
), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to ""unsubscribe"" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
 
Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

Lyft Privacy Policy


Last Updated: December 13, 2023



                    At Lyft our mission is to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation, providing a
                    platform to help you get from point A to point B and enjoy the ride. To do that, we need to collect,
                    use, and share some of your personal information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you
                    understand how Lyft does that and how to exercise the choices and rights you have in your
                    information.
                



                    Lyft’s 
privacy homepage
 provides additional
                    information about our commitment to respecting your personal information, including ways for you to
                    access and delete that information.

The Scope of This Policy



                    This policy applies to all Lyft users, including Riders and Drivers (including Driver applicants),
                    and to all Lyft platforms and services, including our applications, websites, technology,
                    facilities, and other services (collectively, the “Lyft Platform”). This policy applies only to
                    personal information, not to aggregate information or information that does not identify you. Please
                    remember that your use of the Lyft Platform is also subject to our
                    
Terms of Service
. Certain elements of the Lyft Platform may
                    operate under separate or additional terms or practices different from or in addition to those
                    described in this policy; in those cases, you will be provided separate notice and information
                    relevant to your use of those parts of the Lyft Platform.
                




For users in California, Canada, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and
                        Virginia:

                    Additional information regarding Lyft’s privacy practices under location-specific privacy laws is
                    available 
here
.
                






The Information We Collect



                    When you use the Lyft Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and
                    information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like service
                    providers, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other
                    information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:
                




A. Information You Provide to Us




Account Registration.
 When you create an account with Lyft, we collect the
                        information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile
                        photo, and payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider
                        profile, like saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as your
                        preferred pronouns). We may ask that you provide additional information related to the identity
                        of your account, such as documents related to identification (e.g., driver’s license), a profile
                        picture, or “selfie” imagery. If you choose to engage in additional offerings on the Lyft
                        Platform (e.g., services for your vehicle or linking to other accounts like travel rewards), you
                        may provide us additional information relevant to those offerings.
                    




Driver Information.
 If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the
                        information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number,
                        birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social
                        security number), driver’s license information, vehicle information, and car insurance
                        information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing
                        numbers and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for
                        additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and
                        programs relevant to that location. We may need additional information from you at some point
                        after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like “selfie”
                        imagery).
                    




Ratings and Feedback.
 When you rate and provide feedback about the Lyft
                        Platform (including about Riders or Drivers), we collect all of the information you provide in
                        your feedback.
                    




Communications.
 When you contact us or we contact you, including through
                        surveys or research projects, we collect any information that you provide, including the
                        contents of the messages or attachments you send us.
                    






B. Information We Collect When You Use the Lyft Platform




Location Information.
 Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The
                        Lyft Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data, IP address, and
                        Bluetooth data) differently depending on your Lyft app settings and device permissions as well
                        as whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:
                    





                            Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the Lyft app,
                            including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until
                            it ends. Lyft also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.
                        



                            Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including
                            while the app is running in the background. We also collect precise location for a limited
                            time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting
                            it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active. If you choose to install a
                            Lyft Platform device in or on your vehicle (e.g., a Lyft dashboard device or tablet), that
                            device may collect precise location information when turned on.
                        






Usage Information.
 We collect information about your use of the Lyft Platform,
                        including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and
                        whether you used a promotional or referral code. Our e-bikes and scooters may collect mobile
                        sensor data, such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical
                        data. We also collect information about your interactions with the Lyft Platform like our apps
                        and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.
                    




Device Information.
 We collect information about the devices you use to access
                        the Lyft Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating
                        system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings
                        (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising
                        identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor
                        data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other
                        technical data). If you have installed a Lyft Platform device in your vehicle (e.g., a Lyft
                        dashboard device or tablet), that device may similarly collect sensor data and other information
                        like location, as described when you choose and set up such devices.
                    




Communications Between Riders and Drivers.
 We work with a third party to
                        facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either
                        party’s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the
                        communication service, we collect information about these communications and Lyft Platform chat
                        communications, including the participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents
                        of SMS and chat messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of
                        phone calls made through the Lyft Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do
                        so before the call begins.
                    




Address Book Contacts.
 You may set your device permissions to grant Lyft access
                        to your contact lists and direct Lyft to access your contact list, for example to help you refer
                        friends to Lyft. If you choose to do this, we will access the names and contact information of
                        the people in your address book.
                    




Calendar Information.
 You may set your device permissions or otherwise grant
                        Lyft access to your chosen calendar and direct Lyft to access calendar information, for example
                        to help you get alerts to order a ride for your upcoming trip. If you choose to do this, we will
                        access and store information available in your calendar to use in providing you these optional
                        features. Lyft will adhere to the applicable calendar provider policies, including
                        
Google’s API Services User Data Policy
, which impose certain limitations on the use of data collected from user’s calendar accounts.
                        You may remove Lyft’s access to your accounts at any time either in-app or through your account
                        provider settings.
                    




Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies.
 We collect information
                        through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, data analytics tools like
                        
Google Analytics
, SDKs, and
                        other third-party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Lyft Platform and
                        interact with advertisements, to make your Lyft experience safer, to learn what content is
                        popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save
                        your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are
                        designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may
                        use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close
                        your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every
                        time you use the Lyft Platform.
                    




Inferences
. We may infer certain information from your interactions with the
                        Lyft Platform and other personal information available to us. For example, if you frequently
                        ride to or from airports, we may infer you are a frequent traveler. We may also draw inferences
                        from the information you provide to us, such as inferring your gender based on your first name.
                    






C. Information We Collect From Other Sources




Service Providers and Other Parties.
 Service providers and other parties
                        provide us with information needed for core aspects of the Lyft Platform, as well as for
                        additional services, programs, loyalty benefits, and promotions that can enhance your Lyft
                        experience. These service providers and other parties include background check providers,
                        insurance partners, financial service providers, marketing providers, and other businesses. We
                        obtain the following information about you from these parties:
                    





                            Information to make the Lyft Platform safer, like background check information or identity
                            verification information;
                        



                            Information about your participation in third-party programs that provide things like
                            insurance coverage and financial instruments, such as insurance, payment, transaction, and
                            fraud detection information;
                        



                            Information to operationalize loyalty and promotional/marketing programs or applications,
                            services, or features you choose to connect or link to your Lyft account, such as
                            information about your use of such programs, applications, services, or features; and
                        



                            Information about you provided by specific services, such as vehicle, demographic, and other
                            information that helps us provide services or to personalize our marketing.
                        






Enterprise and Delivery Programs.
 If you use Lyft through your employer or
                        other organization that participates in one of our Lyft Business enterprise programs, we will
                        collect information about you from those parties, such as your name and contact information. If
                        an organization has utilized Lyft to fulfill a delivery to you, we may receive information like
                        your name and delivery address from the organization in order to fulfill the delivery.
                    




Concierge Service.
 Sometimes another business or entity may order you a Lyft
                        ride. If an organization has ordered a ride for you using our Concierge service, they will
                        provide us your contact information and the pickup and drop-off location of your ride.
                    




Referral Programs.
 Friends help friends use the Lyft Platform. If someone
                        refers you to Lyft, we will collect information about you from that referral including your name
                        and contact information.
                    




Other Users and Sources.
 Other users or public or third-party sources such as
                        law enforcement, insurers, media, or pedestrians may provide us information about you, for
                        example as part of an investigation into an incident or to provide you support.

                    provide you with new and helpful features. To do this, we use your personal information to:
                




Perform research, testing, and analysis;


Develop new products, features, partnerships, and services;


Prevent, find, and resolve software or hardware bugs and issues; and



                        Monitor and improve our operations and processes, including security practices, algorithms, and
                        other modeling.
                    






Responding to Legal Proceedings and Requirements.
 Sometimes the law, government
                    entities, or other regulatory bodies impose demands and obligations on us with respect to the
                    services we seek to provide. In such a circumstance, we may use your personal information to respond
                    to those demands or obligations.
                






How We Disclose Your Information



                    We do not sell your personal information to third parties for money -- no one can buy the personal
                    information we collect from and about you and we do not act as a data broker. However, we may need
                    to share your personal information with third parties to deliver relevant personalized ads to you on
                    and off the Lyft Platform. Some of these disclosures may constitute “sharing” or the “sale” of
                    personal information for “targeted advertising” purposes under certain local (e.g., U.S. state)
                    privacy laws, which we describe in more detail
                    
here
. This section otherwise explains when, why,
                    and with whom we disclose your information.
                




A. Sharing Between Lyft Users


Riders and Drivers.




Rider information shared with Driver:
 As part of surfacing the ride request and
                        enabling the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup and destination, location, name,
                        profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider),
                        and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns) as well as
                        any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Lyft app. Once the ride is finished, we also
                        eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s
                        identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be
                        able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)
                    




Driver information shared with Rider:
 Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will
                        share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time
                        location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in
                        the Driver’s Lyft profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why
                        you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).
                    



                        Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not
                        share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users when enabling this.
                        If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or
                        Driver, which may include sharing actual contact information with your consent.
                    




Shared Ride Riders.
 When Riders use a Lyft Shared ride, we share each Rider’s
                        name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off
                        locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.
                    




Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.
 Some rides you take may be requested or
                        paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Lyft Business Profile account; a
                        pass, code or coupon; a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government); a corporate credit
                        card linked to another account; or another user or entity otherwise requests or pays for a ride
                        (or portion of a ride) for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other
                        party, including your identity (e.g., name, phone number), the date, time, charge, rating given,
                        region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.
                    




Linked Accounts and Sharing Upon Your Request.
 If you use the Lyft Platform as
                        part of a Lyft Family account linked with others or if you direct us to share your information
                        with trusted contacts, we will then share with those parties information about your use of the
                        Lyft Platform, such as the live location of your ride.
                    




Referral Programs.
 If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let them
                        know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information
                        about your use of the Lyft Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a
                        bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive
                        such information.
                    






B. Disclosures to Service Providers to Provide the Lyft Platform, and Other Parties



                        Depending on whether you’re a Rider or a Driver, Lyft may disclose the following categories of
                        your personal information to provide you with a variety of the Lyft Platform’s features and

                            Commercial information, such as ride information, Driver/Rider statistics and feedback, and

                            This and other information you may direct us to disclose to other parties, such as when you
                            choose to link your Lyft account with a separate travel rewards program or when you choose
                            to engage with an offering from another company through the Lyft Platform, such as a vehicle
                            service.
                        





                        We disclose those categories of personal information to these other parties and service

                        determined that disclosing your personal information is reasonably necessary or appropriate to:

E. Upon Your Further Direction



                        With your permission or upon your direction, we may disclose your personal information to

How We Store and Protect Your Information



                    We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Lyft
                    Platform. This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We
                    retain transactional information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure we
                    can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. We also retain
                    your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our
                    terms and policies. If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in
                    the “Deleting Your Account” section below.
                



                    We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information. But no
                    security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information,
                    including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.
                






Your Rights And Choices Regarding Your Data



                    As explained more below and on our 
privacy homepage
,
                    Lyft provides ways for you to access and delete your personal information as well as exercise
                    applicable data rights that give you certain control over your personal information.
                




A. All Users




Email Subscriptions.
 You can always unsubscribe from our commercial or
                        promotional emails by clicking unsubscribe in those messages. We will still send you
                        transactional and relational emails about your use of the Lyft Platform.
                    




Text Messages.
 You can opt out of receiving commercial or promotional text
                        messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. You may
                        also opt out of receiving all texts from Lyft (including transactional or relational messages)
                        by texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. Note that
                        opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use of the Lyft Platform. Drivers can also opt
                        out of driver-specific messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS. To re-enable texts
                        you can text START in response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.
                    




Push Notifications.
 You can opt out of receiving push notifications through
                        your device settings. Please note that opting out of receiving push notifications may impact
                        your use of the Lyft Platform (such as receiving a notification that your ride has arrived).
                    




Profile Information.
 You can review and edit certain account information you
                        have chosen to add to your profile by logging in to your account settings and profile.
                    




Location Information.
 You can prevent your device from sharing location
                        information through your device’s system settings. But if you do, this may impact Lyft’s ability
                        to provide you our full range of features and services. You may also control some elements of
                        sharing your location with Lyft in your Lyft account settings.
                    




Cookie Tracking.

Accessing Your Information.
 If you would like to access your personal
                        information, please visit our 
privacy homepage
.
                        You can also see information we have about you by logging into your account and viewing things
                        like your profile, settings, and preferences (like preferred pronouns and address shortcuts such
                        as home and work), ride history, or payment information. In addition, you may have some
                        information included in things we have sent to you, such as ride receipts.
                    




Deleting Your Account.
 If you would like to delete your Lyft account, please
                        visit our 
privacy homepage
. In some cases, we
                        will be unable to delete your account, such as if there is an issue with your account related to
                        trust, safety, or fraud. When we delete your account, we may retain certain information for
                        legitimate business purposes or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. For example, we
                        may retain your information to resolve open insurance claims, or we may be obligated to retain
                        your information as part of an open legal claim. When we retain such data, we do so in ways
                        designed to prevent its use for other purposes.
                    






B. Location-Specific Rights

                        Virginia provide specific rights to residents of the state regarding personal information.
                        Similarly, specific rights may be provided in Canada. To see more information about these rights
                        and how to exercise them, see

Children’s Data



                    Lyft is not directed to children, and we don’t knowingly collect personal information from children
                    under the age of 16. If we find out that a child under 16 has given us personal information, we will
                    take steps to delete that information. If you believe that a child under the age of 16 has given us
                    personal information, please contact us at our 
Help Center
.

                    policies. Please contact those parties directly if you have any questions about their privacy
                    policies.

, a company duly registered under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus (with a registration address at 6 24 Peiraios Str., 1st floor, Strovolos, Nicosia, 2023, Cyprus) will be the controller of your personal data.






CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT




We collect data you give us voluntarily (for example, an email address). We also collect data automatically (for example, your IP address).








Data you give us




We do not ask you to provide information about yourself when you register for and/or use the Service. However, sometimes you may also need to provide us your email address and some other information in the communication to our Support Team in order to fulfill your request.






Data we collect automatically:






Data about how you found us




We collect data about your referring app or URL (that is, the app or place on the Web where you were when you tapped on our ad).






Device and Location data.




We collect data from your mobile device. Examples of such data include: language settings, IP address, time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating system, Internet service provider, mobile carrier, hardware ID, and Facebook ID.






Usage data




We record how you interact with our Service. For example, we log your taps on certain areas of the interface, the features, and content you interact with, how often you use the App, how long you are in the App, what sections you use, and your App purchases.






Advertising IDs




We collect your Apple Identifier for Advertising (“IDFA”) or Google Advertising ID (“AAID”) (depending on the operating system of your device). You can typically reset these numbers through the settings of your device’s operating system (but we do not control this).






FOR WHAT PURPOSES WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA




We process your personal data: 




To provide our Service




This includes enabling you to use the Service in a seamless manner and preventing or addressing Service errors or technical issues.






To monitor infrastructure and the App’s performance, we use
 Crashlytics
, which is a monitoring service provided by Google. Here’s its 
Data Collection Policy
.


We use
 Firebase Performance Monitoring 
and
 Firebase Crash Reporting, 
which are monitoring services provided by Google. To learn more, please visit Google’s 
Privacy policy
 and 
Privacy and Security in Firebase
.




To manage your account and provide you with customer support




We process your personal data to respond to your requests for technical support, Service information or to any other communication you initiate. This includes accessing your account to address technical support requests. For this purpose, we may send you, for example, notifications or emails about the performance of our Service, security, payment transactions, notices regarding our 
Terms and Conditions of Use
 or this Privacy Policy.




To communicate with you regarding your use of our Service




We communicate with you, for example, by push notifications. These may include reminders or other information about the App. As a result, you may, for example, receive a push notification reminding you to finish your daily brain training. To opt out of receiving push notifications, you need to change the settings on your device.






The services that we use for these purposes may collect data concerning the date and time when the message was viewed by our App’s users, as well as when they interacted with it, such as by clicking on links included in the message.




To communicate with you we also use 
Firebase Cloud Messaging and Firebase Notifications
, which
 
are message sending services provided by Google. Firebase Cloud Messaging allows us to send messages and notifications to users of our App across platforms such as Android and iOS. We integrate 
Firebase Notifications
 with 
Firebase Analytics
 to create analytics-based audiences and track opening and conversion events. As a result, we can, for example, send reminders only to users who actively use the App. Google's 
privacy policy
. 


We use 
Apple Push Notification
 service (“APNs”), that is a notifications service provided by Apple. APNs allows us to send information to iOS devices. Apple’s 
privacy policy
.




To research and analyze your use of the Service




This helps us to better understand our business, analyze our operations, maintain, improve, innovate, plan, design, and develop the App and our new products. We also use such data for statistical analysis purposes, to test and improve our offers. This enables us to better understand what features and sections of the App our users like more, what categories of users use our App. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve the App based on the results obtained from this processing. For example, if we discover that users are more interested in training games for memory improvement, we may focus on developing more exercises for memory in the App.




To perform research and analysis about how users interact with our App we use 
Appsflyer
. Appsflyer enables us to understand, in particular, how users find us (for example, who was the advertiser that delivered an ad to users, which led you to an app store with our App). Appsflyer also provides us with different analytics tools that enable us to research and analyze your use of the Service.

We use 
Facebook Analytics
, which is a service provided by Facebook that allows us to use different analytical tools. On Facebook Analytics we get, in particular, aggregated demographics and insights on how many people launch our App, how often users make purchases, and other interactions. Lean more about Facebook’s approach to data from its 
Privacy Policy




To track and analyze behavior of our App’s users (in particular, how they react to changes of the App structure, text or any other component), we use 
Firebase Remote Config
. Firebase Remote Config is an A/B testing and configuration service provided by Google, which also enables us to tailor the content that our App’s users see (for example, it allows us to show different onboarding screens to different users).

Amplitude collects various technical information, in particular, time zone, type of device (phone or tablet), unique identifiers (such as IDFA). Amplitude also allows us to track various interactions that occur in our App. As a result, Amplitude helps us to decide what features/languages we should we focus on. Amplitude is 
EU-US Privacy Shield certified
. Amplitude provides more information on how they process data in its 
Privacy Policy

To send you marketing communications




We process your personal data for our marketing campaigns. As a result, you will receive information about our products, such as, for example, special offers.




We may also show you advertisements in our App, and send you push notifications for marketing purposes. To opt out of receiving push notifications, you need to change the settings on your device.






To personalize our ads




We and our partners use your personal data to tailor our ads and possibly even show them to you at the relevant time. For example, if you have installed our App, you might see ads of our products, for example, in your Facebook’s feed.




How to opt out or influence personalized advertising


iOS:
 On your iPhone or iPad, go to “Settings” then “Privacy” and tap “Advertising” to select “Limit Ad Track”. In addition, you can reset your advertising identifier (this also may help you to see less of personalized ads) in the same section.




Android:
 To opt-out of ads on an Android device, simply open the Google Settings app on your mobile phone, tap “Ads” and enable “Opt out of interest-based ads”. In addition, you can reset your advertising identifier in the same section (this also may help you to see less of personalized ads).

We value your right to influence the ads that you see, thus, we are letting you know what service providers we use for this purpose and how some of them allow you to control your ad preferences.




We use 
Facebook Ads Manager
 together with 
Facebook Custom Audience
,
 
which allows us to choose audiences that will see our ads on Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for example, Instagram). Through Facebook Custom Audience we may create a list of users with certain sets of data, such as an IDFA, and choose users that have completed certain actions in the App (for example, installed it). As a result, we may ask Facebook to show some ads to a particular list of users. As a result, more of our ads may show up while you are using Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for example, Instagram). You may learn how to opt out of advertising provided to you through Facebook Custom Audience 
here
.


Facebook also allows its users to influence the types of ads they see on Facebook. To find how to control the ads you see on Facebook, please go 
here 
or adjust your ads settings on 
Facebook
.


Google Ads
 is an ad delivery service provided by Google that can deliver ads to users. In particular, Google allows us to tailor the ads in a way that they will appear, for example, only to users that have conducted certain actions with our App (for example, show our ads to users who have purchased a subscription). Some other examples of events that may be used for tailoring ads include, in particular, installing our App, finishing a free trial. Google allows its users to 
opt out of Google’s personalized ads
 and to 
prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics
.


To deliver ads to you we use
 Appodeal
, which is a mobile ads management and analytics platform. Please refer to 
Appodeal’s Privacy Policy
 to learn more about its data processing practices. To opt-out from receiving ads from Appodeal follow the instructions described

            defend ourselves against legal claims or disputes. Where we do so,
            we will use the Personal Data relevant to such a case. Some
            processing may also be necessary to comply with a legal obligation
            placed on Locket for example to keep records of transactions, or as
            requested by any judicial process or governmental agency.
          




For aggregation and anonymization.

            It is in our legitimate interests to aggregate or anonymize Personal
            Data in a form that does not allow users to be personally identified
            and use the resulting information for statistical analysis regarding
            the use of the Services, such as to better understand our customer
            base, or for other purposes.
          





          We will only process Personal Data on the basis of our legitimate
          interests where such interests are not overridden by your interests or
          your fundamental rights and freedoms.
        



          If, where we are processing your Personal Data to perform our contract
          with you, you do not provide the Personal Data, we may not be able to
          conclude or fulfill such contract.
        


4. How we disclose your Personal Data



          We disclose Personal Data about you with the following recipients and
          in the following circumstances:
        






Affiliates:

            Affiliates and subsidiaries of Locket, for purposes consistent with
            this Policy.
          




Service Providers for the provision of our Services:

            We rely on vendors and service providers solely for the provision of
            our Services and for the purposes set out above, such as providers
            of analytics, hosting and cloud computing services and other IT
            services and customer support services in addition to other
            administrative services, and advertising technology vendors. These
            third parties may have access to or process your Personal Data as part
            of providing these services.
          




Advertising Partners:

            We share information that you provide through the Services or that we
            automatically collect (described under “Information Collected via Automated
            Means” above), such as the links you click, pages you visit, IP address,
            advertising ID, and device type, with advertising companies for interest-based
            advertising. Sharing this information allows us and our advertising partners
            to target and serve advertising to you.
          




Advisors:

            We work with various advisors, including tax consultants and legal
            advisors, to whom we may disclose your Personal Data.
          




Legal:

            Information about our users, including Personal Data, will be
            disclosed to law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies, public
            authorities or pursuant to the exercise of legal proceedings if we
            are legally required to do so, or if we believe, in good faith, that
            such disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or
            request, to enforce our terms and conditions, to prevent or resolve
            security or technical issues, or to protect the rights, property or
            safety of Locket, users, a third party, or the public.
          




Business Transaction:

            If Locket is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale,
            financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership,
            sale of company assets, or transition of service to another
            provider, your Personal Data may be sold, transferred or otherwise
            disclosed including as part of any due diligence process.
          






You can use Locket to share photos and videos with your friends. 
            Once you’ve sent a photo it isn’t possible to delete it from other
            user’s phones, even if you delete it from your own, so please be
            careful what photos you choose to send.

            Data that we process. Depending on your location and the nature of
            your interactions with our Services, you may request the following
            in relation to Personal Data:
            




Information

                used Personal Data. We have made this information available to
                you without having to request it by including it in this Policy;
              




Access
 a copy of the Personal Data we hold
                about you;
              




Correction
 of Personal Data that is inaccurate
                or out of date;
              




Deletion

                can delete your account in your account settings;
              



                Receive any Personal Data we hold about you in a

machine readable
 format
 or have such
                Personal Data transmitted to another company;
              




Opt out of selling Personal Data and sharing for targeted advertising

                We share information with third-party advertising partners and allow them to collect
                information about your use of the Services to show you ads on our Services as described
                in the “How we use your personal data” and “How we disclose your personal data” sections
                above. Our disclosure of information to these partners may be considered a “sale” or
                “sharing” of Personal Data or “targeted advertising” under applicable laws. You can
                opt out of these disclosures and limit our use of tracking technologies as described
                in our 
Cookie Policy
 or by clicking the “Your Privacy Choices”
                link in your Locket Widget mobile application.
              




Withdraw any consent
 you previously provided to
                us regarding the processing of your Personal Data at any time.
                We will apply your preferences going forward. This will not
                affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdrew your
                consent;
              




Additional rights,
 such as to object to and
                request that we restrict our use of Personal Data.
              





              To make a request, please email us or write to us as provided in
              the “Contact us” section below. We may ask for specific
              information from you to help us confirm your identity. Depending
              on where you reside, you may be entitled to empower an authorized
              agent to submit requests on your behalf. We will require
              authorized agents to confirm their identity and authority, in
              accordance with applicable laws. You are entitled to exercise the
              rights described above free from discrimination.
            



              In some instances, your choices may be limited, such as where
              fulfilling your request would impair the rights of others, our
              ability to provide a service you have requested, or our ability to
              comply with our legal obligations and enforce our legal rights. If
              you are not satisfied with how we address your request, you may
              submit a complaint by contacting us at
              
privacy@locketcamera.com
. Depending on where you reside, such as if you reside in the
              European Economic Area (""
EEA
”) or United Kingdom
              (“
UK
”), you may have the right to complain to a data
              protection regulator where you live or work, or where you feel a
              violation has occurred. For example, if you are based in the UK,
              you may choose to lodge a complaint with the Information
              Commissioner’s Office at
              
https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/
.
            






6. International data transfers



          If you provide us with your Personal Data when using the Services from
          the EEA, Switzerland or the UK or other regions of the world with laws
          governing data collection and use that may differ from United States
          law, then please note that you are transferring your Personal Data
          outside of those regions to the United States for storage and
          processing.
        



          If we transfer your Personal Data internationally, these countries may
          not provide the same protections as the data protection laws where you
          are based.  We will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to
          afford adequate protection for your Personal Data and we will comply
          with applicable data protection laws, in particular if you reside in
          the EEA, Switzerland or UK by relying on an EU Commission or UK
          government adequacy decision, on contractual protections for the
          transfer of your Personal Data or a derogation if available.  For more
          information about how we transfer Personal Data internationally,
          please contact us as set out in the “
Contact Us
” section below.
        


7. Children’s privacy



          Our Services are not directed to children, and we do not knowingly
          collect Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13.  If you are a
          parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
          with Personal Data, please contact us as set out in the “
Contact Us
” section below.
        


8. Retention of Personal Data



          We retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary to
          fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, in
          accordance with our retention procedures, and in accordance with
          applicable laws or until you withdraw your consent (where applicable).
        



          To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data,
          we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data,
          the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
          Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and
          whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
          applicable legal requirements.
        


9. Security of Personal Data



          We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative
          measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, misuse,
          loss, disclosure, alteration and destruction of Personal Data we
          process.  Unfortunately, data transmission over the Internet cannot be
          guaranteed as completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect
          your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its security.
        


10. Links to other sites



          The Services may contain links to other sites that are not operated by
          us.  If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that
          third party’s site.  We strongly advise you to review the privacy
          policy of every site you visit.
        



          We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
          privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
        


11. Changes and updates to this Policy



          We will update this Policy from time to time.  Please review this
          Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Policy are
          effective when they are posted on this page.
        


If we make material changes, we will let you know.

Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy was last updated on November 14, 2023. See previous versions of the Privacy Policy in our
 
Policy Archives.
The highlighted text is aimed to give a plain English summary of our Privacy Policy. Please ensure you read the main text, as the plain English summary is just a summary and doesn’t capture all of the terms.
 
What does this policy cover
Welcome to Canva, the online and mobile service of Canva Pty Ltd (“Canva,” “we,” or “us”). Our Privacy Policy explains how Canva and its affiliates collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our visual communication platform (the ""Service""), and your choices about the collection and use of your information. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our 
Terms of Use
. If you do not want your information processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use our Service. This policy applies to all users of the Service, including, but not limited to users of our 
Developer Portal
.
Summary: Welcome, here is our policy on privacy. This policy sets out how Canva collects and uses the information that we collect about you when you use the Service. This policy also explains the choices that you can make about the way that we use your information.
1. Information we collect
We collect the following types of information about you:
(a) Information you provide us directly
We may ask for certain information when you register for a Canva account or correspond with us (such as a username, your first and last names, birthdate, phone number, profession, physical and e-mail address).
We also collect any messages you send us through the Service (such as user feedback, search queries and prompts), and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service (such as text and photos you upload to use in your designs). We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Service to you, to correspond with you, and to address any issues you raise about the Service.
If you don’t provide your personal information to us, you may not be able to access or use our Service or your experience of using our Service may not be as enjoyable.
Summary: We collect info about you that you choose to give us, for example when you register an account, use the Service or otherwise interact with us. 
(b) Information we receive from third-party applications
We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access the Service through a third-party connection or log-in, such as Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Canva application, linking your account to the Canva Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Canva. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will no longer receive information collected about you in connection with that service. And if you choose to integrate with a third party application to incorporate elements into your designs, enhance media, supercharge your workflow or share to social media, we could receive data from such apps (as well as disclose data to such apps). If you communicate with us via social media, including Instagram, Facebook or TikTok and choose to share your user generated content with us, we may receive information such as videos you’ve created, your photo, your account name and your comments about Canva.
Summary: When you use our Service, for example, if you log in through a third-party application, we may obtain information about you from such third-party application. 
(c) Information we receive from other third parties
We may obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as public sources, social media platforms (like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and other platforms) and third-party data providers and information services. Examples of the information we may obtain from such third parties include your company, company size, job title and seniority, industry and other profile information. We may share your email address or other information in order to obtain and combine this information with information that you provide to us or other information that we collect when you use our Service. We do this to better understand your profile and interests so that we can deliver customized offers and other personalized services to you, such as to serve relevant offers to you via email, chatbots, phone or personalized advertising. You can opt out of Canva collecting more data about you from third-party providers to tailor your experience and messages we send you 
here
.
Some of these providers may combine data collected from our Service through cookies, pixels, tags and similar technologies, with email or mailing addresses to which they have access to help us serve relevant offers to you.
If you are not a Canva subscriber, we may obtain your contact details from a social media platform, such as LinkedIn, or a third party data provider, so that we can promote our product offerings and subscriptions to you if we think they would be helpful in your role.
We also may have obtained your details from another Canva user, for example when they have shared a design with you.
We may also receive information about you and your engagement with our advertisements from our ad servers, ad networks and social media platforms. This may include the websites you visited before coming to Canva so that we can determine advertising effectiveness and pay our referral partners.
If you prefer not to have your information used for this purpose, you can opt out at any time by emailing us at 
privacy@canva.com
.
Canva for Education: 
Please note that references to utilizing third-party information for offers and advertising in this Section 1(c) do not apply to students using Canva for Education. We do not serve advertising to students using Canva for Education. 
Summary: We may obtain information about you from third-party sources so that we can understand your interests and personalize our communications and promotions to you. You can opt out at any time.
 
(d) Information we collect from you automatically
We will directly collect or generate certain information about your use of the Service (such as user activity data, analytics event data, and clickstream data) for data analytics and machine learning, and to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. We may also use third party analytics tools that automatically collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. For more information please see the paragraphs below on cookies information, log file information, clear gifs, device identifiers, and location data.
Summary: We collect and generate certain info about how you use our Service automatically. This helps us to provide and improve the Service for you. 
(e) Cookies information and information taken from similar technologies
When you visit the Service, we (and our third-party partners) will send cookies — small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Canva do things like help you log in faster, enhance your navigation through the site, remember your preferences and generally improve the user experience. Cookies also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. They also allow us to measure traffic and usage trends for the Service, deliver personalized advertisements that may be of interest to you and measure their effectiveness, and find potential new users of the Service.
You can control or reset your cookies and similar technologies through your web browser, which will allow you to customize your cookie preferences and to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. For more information on how we use cookies and other technologies and how you can control them, please read our 
Cookies Policy
.
Canva for Education: 
Please note that references to utilizing cookies for advertising in this Section 1(e) do not apply to students using ""Canva for Education"" - we do not serve advertising to students using Canva for Education.
Summary: We use cookies to help you use Canva and for other business purposes. For more information about how we use cookies and how you can control them, please see our Cookies Policy.
(f) Log file information
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Summary: Whenever you load a page from Canva, your browser sends us info about itself and your interactions with our Service. That info gets stored on our servers.
(g) Clear gifs/web beacons information
When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. This information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
Summary: We might use small images in order to check how many people open our emails and visit our site.
(h) Device identifiers
When you access the Service on a device (including smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect and/or monitor one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”).

3. Sharing your information
(a) How we share your information 
We share your information with third-party service providers for the purpose of providing the Service to you, to facilitate Canva’s legitimate interests or if you consent. These service providers are vetted by us, and will only be provided with access to your information as is reasonably necessary for the purpose that Canva has engaged the service provider. We require that such third parties comply with applicable laws, and have security, privacy and data retention policies consistent with our policies.
Some of the third parties with whom Canva may share your personal information are service providers who assist Canva with functions such as:
Billing;
Customer support and customer management;
Email services;
Hosting and storage;
Data analytics and predictive analytics;
Data labelling and machine learning;
Security;
Advertising and marketing services;
Domain name registration;
Delivery of physical products; and
Other service providers.
Summary: We might share some information about you with our business partners and third-party service providers in order to provide the Service to you or to fulfill Canva’s legitimate business interests.
(b) How you can share your User Content 
(i) Public Posts
Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as public User Content, becomes available to be read, collected and used by the public. When you set your profile to public, or make User Content public, your information becomes publicly available globally, searchable by other users and can be indexed by search engines. If you or Canva remove information that you posted to the Service, copies remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information.
You may share your Canva designs to your social media accounts, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr. You should ensure that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of each of these services and any privacy settings that may apply to the designs you choose to share on those accounts.
(ii) Teams
If you are part of a Team, then any information or content that you create in that Team or activity you take within the Team may be shared with other Team members and the Team Owner. If requested by the Team Owner, Canva may re-assign ownership of any User Content you post in the Team to the Team Owner or to another Team member. The Team Owner or any Team Administrator in your Team may also move, delete or edit any folders or items you share with them, or the Team.
You should ensure that any personal information, confidential information, or User Content that you’d like to keep private is retained in a separate personal account.
(iii) Design Collaboration
 If you accept an invitation to view or edit a Canva design:
your name and avatar will be visible to anyone else in the design at the same time as you, whether or not they are logged in to Canva or anonymous;
your name and time of login will become available to any other person that also has edit access to that design, whether or not they are within your Team. 
If you do not wish for this to occur, simply 
click here
 and select ""Opt out of insights collection"" under the Insights section to make your access anonymous.
As the owner or editor of an individual design, you can choose to give other people access to your designs using the following link sharing settings:
1. “
Only people added can access
”: Only people who have been added to those designs via their email or Canva account will have access to your design. Anyone who hasn’t been added to a design will need to request access from you. This is the most private sharing option, and Canva uses this as the default setting for all designs .
2. “
Anyone with the link
”: Anyone on the internet who has the link can access your design (and view or edit if you select this). We do not recommend this option for information you wish to keep confidential. Please note that this setting will, by default (except for Canva for Education subscriptions) also allow non-Canva users to anonymously access your design (and view the full names, avatars, cursors and comments of logged in users).
3. “Only your team*”:
 Only people on your team that have the link can access, view or edit (as you select) your design. This means if you share the link on an email or Slack communication with numerous people in your Team, any of them can access the design without further permission. *Subject to being made available for your team.
Canva collects your links and they may be shared with service providers where required to provide the Services. Once you share a link, it may be on-shared by your recipients.
Summary: Our designs are private by default. When sharing designs, make sure the privacy settings are appropriate. For designs with personal or confidential information, we don’t recommend ""anyone with the link"" setting.
(c) Sharing in connection with a merger, acquisition or reorganization
Canva may also share, sell or transfer your information to third parties in connection with or contemplation of (including as part of the due diligence process) any merger, acquisition, reorganization, financing, sale of assets, bankruptcy or insolvency event involving Canva or any portion of our assets, services or businesses. Information such as customer names and email addresses, User Content and other user information related to the Service may be among the items shared, sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. You will be notified via email and/or a notice on the Service if such a transaction takes place and be given notice of any material changes to the way we handle your data under this policy. 
Summary: If we sell our business, any of the info which we’ve acquired about you may be part of the sale.
(d) Your employer
If you access Canva with an email address issued to you by your employer (either a business, non-profit or educational institution), and your employer has established an account with Canva (or is considering doing so), you acknowledge that Canva may share your name, email, and basic account information
with your employer. If you do not use Canva in connection with your employment and do not wish for this information to be shared with your employer you can opt out at any time by emailing us at 
privacy@canva.com
.
Summary: We might share limited information with your employer. 
(e) Sharing with other third parties
Canva will also share your information with third parties in certain circumstances, such as where you consent to our sharing it with a third party for a particular purpose.
You or your account administrator may also choose to work with third-party products integrated into Canva or third-party applications (listed 
here
) from within Canva so that you can incorporate elements into your designs (e.g., YouTube, an application that uses the YouTube API Services and users agree to be bound by the YouTube 
Terms of Service
 and Google 
Privacy Policy
, and Google Drive), enhance your media (e.g., with duotone and shadows) or supercharge your workflow (e.g., with LinkedIn or Slack). For example, you may install a third-party document sharing app in order to store, share and edit content through our Service. Using third party-products or integrating with third party applications could involve importing data from that third party to Canva and/or exporting data from Canva to that third party. If this requires connecting your Canva account to your account on the third party application, you will be asked for permission. 
These third-party products and apps are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. You should review the terms and conditions of any third party apps before connecting them to the Service. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, do not use the product or install the app.

Canva may share certain information with our third party advertising partners, such as your email address, location, cookie information and information relating to your use of our Service, and allow partners to perform a match of your information against information from other third party networks or sites to serve ads either on the Service or on third party sites (including, but not limited to Facebook, Google and Samsung televisions) and to measure the effectiveness of these ads. We also share certain information with social media platforms, such as Facebook and Tiktok, to display advertising to potential new users whose demographics and behaviour look like those of our existing users. You can opt out of having your email matched by Liveramp 
here
 or by emailing 
privacy@canva.com
. 
In addition, these third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, these personalized ads and ad links directly to your browser or mobile device, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Please see our 
Cookies Policy
 for more information about how we and our third party partners use cookies and other technologies to deliver ads to you. 
Canva does not sell or rent the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.
Please note that an advertiser may ask Canva to show an ad on the Service to a certain audience of users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Canva determines the target audience and Canva serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
The Canva Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.
Canva for Education:
 Please note that this Section 4 does not apply to students using Canva for Education – we do not serve advertising to students using Canva for Education.
Summary: If we have ads on our site we might use some of your info to show you appropriate ads. We may also use some of that info to send you relevant ads on other sites, like Facebook or Google.

Your information collected through the Service will be stored and processed in the United States, Australia, Singapore, European Union, United Kingdom, Philippines and New Zealand and any other country in which Canva or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities or employ staff or contractors. Canva transfers information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, and to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. As a result, we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

Where required under applicable laws, you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Canva or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we may not be able to provide a copy of your information where it infringes on the rights of another user. In some cases, you may have shared your information with third parties, such as by publishing a design on a third party’s website. In that case Canva will not be able to delete the information, and you will need to contact that third party directly.
If we are unable to resolve your request, or if you are concerned about a potential violation, you also have the option to report the issue or make a complaint to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction.

If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent where this is required, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us at 
privacy@canva.com
.
Canva for Education:
 Children who are students may use our 
Canva for Education
 service under the supervision of their teacher. 
 
For the purposes of the Canva for Education product, a “Student” means an individual enrolled in a K-12 school (or primary or secondary school for countries who do not use the K-12 designation) invited to use Canva for Education by a Teacher or administrator.
Canva's collection of student data is authorized by participating teachers and/or educational institutions obtaining parental consent or providing consent on behalf of the parent, if applicable, or as a proxy for the parent in certain circumstances. We will share student data with our third party service providers who have security, privacy, and data retention policies consistent with our policies and solely to the extent necessary for them to perform a business or technology support function for us. This may include data processing, account management or providing us with usage analytics. Canva does not sell student data.
The following third party service providers will process student data for the sole purpose of delivering the Canva for Education service. If a school deletes their Canva for Education account, or requests the deletion of personally identifiable information associated with a student’s account, Canva will direct these services to delete any such information they hold:
Provider (Purpose)
Amazon Web Services (data storage, service emails)
Amplitude (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)
Atlassian (user support)
Ada (chatbot for user support)
Appbot (user support)
Braze (email communications)
Canva Solutions, Inc. (user support)
Concentrix (user support)
Elastic (data logging)
Jira (user support)
Loggly (logging)
Looker (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)
Mode (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)
MongoDB (Atlas) (data storage)
Sentry (error monitoring)
SheerID (teacher verification)
Slack (platform support)
Snowflake (data storage)
Zendesk (user support)
OpenAI (Canva AI products, only when enabled by the authorized school)
Annually, at or around the end of the school year, if a student account has not been logged into by a student for more than 12 months, we will send an email to the email address associated with that account to notify the student that their account will be deleted unless they log into such account. If the student does not log in to their account within 3 months following the receipt of that email, we will delete that account.
Upon termination of a school’s Canva for Education account, we will delete all student accounts associated with that school.
Educational institutions will have direct control of student data at all times. If a school wishes to inspect, review, amend or delete data we have collected from a student, they may submit an authorised request to 
privacy@canva.com
 or to any of the contact details provided in section 14 below. Such a request must come from the email address that owns or is the Team Owner of the Canva for Education account. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify the school’s identity before granting access to any personal information.
If you are part of a Canva for Education Team, whether this is at a classroom or school level (“
School Team
”), the educational institution your Team is employed by or part of (“
District Team
”), may request to add your School Team to its District Team. Such a request must come from the email address that owns or is the Team Owner of the District. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify the district's identity and relationship to the School Team before granting access to any personal information. If your Team is added to a District Team, then any information or content that you created in the School Team or activity you have taken within the School may be shared with the Team Owner of the District. If requested by the Team Owner of the District, Canva may re-assign ownership of any User Content you post in the School Team to District Team. You should ensure that any personal information, intellectual property or confidential information that you’d like to maintain ownership over is retained or moved to a separate personal account with an email address not issued by your employer.
Canva and its service providers may communicate directly with students for technical support purposes where requested by the student or their teacher. Canva may also send emails in relation to product changes, privacy changes and other service-related emails to students and teachers.
Students may use Canva Sites (as defined in our 
Terms of Use
) if the functionality is enabled by their teacher, school or school district. These will not be indexed by search engines by default, meaning that they cannot be found by Google or another browser search and could only be accessed by people with the specific link. However, this default can be switched off by teachers so that the sites are indexed by search engines.
All designs in a Canva for Education account are private by default so that only people specifically added to the design can access it. A student may make their design public so that anyone with the link can access, view or edit it. But it will only be accessible to anonymous, non-logged in users if a teacher turns on anonymous collaboration (which is switched off by default). This might occur to facilitate collaboration with students that are not registered with Canva or have forgotten their password. This will allow them to view or edit a design.
(U.S. only): Canva for Education has been certified compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) by 
iKeepSafe
. Teachers and parents may contact us on +1 855 228 9195 (toll free) with inquiries concerning our Privacy Policy and use of children’s information.

 set out the circumstances where Canva processes personal data as a processor. In these cases, it is the Canva customer that is responsible for the processing of your personal data and Canva’s processing will be governed by the terms of the 
Data Processing Addendum
 it has entered with the customer. If you have questions or concerns about how your personal data is handled by one of our customers, you should contact the relevant customer that is using our Service and refer to their separate privacy policies.
 (b) Legal bases for processing
If you are located in the EEA, Switzerland or UK, we need a lawful basis to collect, use and disclose your personal data as a controller. Our lawful basis will depend on the information concerned and the context in which it is processed. 
Generally, Canva will collect and use your information as follows:
Contractual necessity: We need it to provide the Service to you and fulfil our obligations to you under our 
Terms of Use
. For example, this includes creating and maintaining your account, resolving issues you may experience with the Service, obtaining payment for our Services and providing you with access to your designs.
Legitimate interests: It is necessary for our legitimate interests for example, providing a useful and customized Service, sending you relevant marketing messages, displaying advertising and tracking its effectiveness, using information we collect about you (like your spending, platform usage, occupation and employer) so that we can make more informed predictions, decisions and offers for our users, helping users connect with team members and their employer's subscription on Canva and enhancing our Service via research and development, data analytics, data labelling, machine learning and predictive analytics relating to your usage data. We do not rely on this lawful basis where our legitimate interests are overridden by your rights and interests.
Consent: You consent to us, and our third party partners, using your information in a certain way – for example, to hear about new features or offers, and for machine learning and predictive analysis relating to your User Content.
Legal obligations: It is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations – for example, to disclose your information in response to law enforcement requests and to retain your information for our record keeping purposes.
If you consented to our use of your information, you can withdraw that consent at any time. Depending on the situation you can either withdraw your consent by emailing 
privacy@canva.com
, or through your 
account settings page
.
Where we use your information for our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to that use by contacting 
privacy@canva.com
. However, if you do, it may diminish the quality of the Service you receive or prevent you from using the Service.
(c) Cross-border transfers of information
By signing up, you understand and agree that Canva Pty Ltd (an entity in Australia) will receive and process your personal data. We may transfer your personal data to other countries where our affiliates and service providers are located. Please note that some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). For Canva users in the EEA, Switzerland or UK, where we transfer your information to a third-party service provider that is not located in Europe, and is not in a country that benefits from an adequacy decision by the European Commission, UK or Swiss authorities, we will require those third party providers to enter into an agreement that provides appropriate safeguards for your information, including by using the EU Model Clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum.
Summary: If you are accessing our Service from Europe, Canva Pty Ltd is the controller of your personal data. In some cases, though, we may only be processing your information on behalf of a Team as a processor. We only process your data if we have a lawful basis. We may transfer your information outside of Europe subject to appropriate safeguards.
12. Additional information for users in the United States
This section of the policy applies to Canva users that are located in the United States. In certain U.S. states, Canva users have additional rights afforded to them under applicable state privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act.
(a) Categories of personal information collected by Canva

For details on how we use that information, who we share it with, and how long we keep it, please see section 2 “How we use your information”, section 3 “Sharing your information”, and section 8 “How long we keep your information.”
(b) Rights in respect of your personal information
These state privacy laws give resident users various rights with respect to the personal information we collect, including the right to (subject to applicable law and certain limitations):
Request access to the personal information Canva has collected about you;
Request that Canva delete your personal information;
Request that Canva correct inaccurate personal information;
Opt out from the ""sale"" of your personal information;
Opt out of the ""sharing"" of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising;
Appeal decisions where we deny your rights request.
(c) Exercising your rights

Depending on applicable state law, you may also appeal a refusal to take action on a request by contacting us at privacy@canva.com.
You may opt out of the “selling or sharing” of your personal information, which may include us sharing your information with third party advertising partners as described in section 4 ""Advertising"" or providing your employer with information confirming whether or not you use Canva using their email domain, as described in section 3(d) ""Your employer"". You can opt out by following the instructions on the “Do not sell or share my personal information” banner, or by emailing privacy@canva.com.
Canva for Education:
 We do not sell or share personal information of students using Canva for Education.
Summary: Certain U.S. state laws give resident users certain rights with respect to their personal information
13. Changes to this Policy
We may update this policy from time to time to reflect our current practice and ensure compliance with applicable laws. When we post changes to this policy, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy. If we make any material changes to the way we collect, use, store and/or share your personal information, we will notify you on our website or by sending an email to the email address associated with your Canva account. We recommend that you check this page from time to time to inform yourself of any changes.
Children using Canva for Education:
 If we make any material changes to the way we collect, use, store and/or share personal information about children using Canva for Education, we will notify students and their teachers or educational institution of the updated privacy policy by email and/or notification on the Service.
Summary: We won’t make any major changes to our Privacy Policy without giving notice – but it’s still a good idea to visit this page every now and then.

				Last Updated: June 1, 2023
			

					As a Human Capital Management (HCM) provider, ADP processes a vast amount of personal data. We process the personal data of our Clients’ employees on behalf of our Clients, and of our business contacts. In order to provide the highest level of data protection, ADP has adopted Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) for processing Client employee data and business contact data. In addition, ADP has implemented BCR for processing personal data of ADP Associates. These BCRs serve as the basis for our Global Privacy Program. We have implemented a Global Privacy Policy that is applicable to all ADP Associates worldwide, enabling us to comply with the commitments we’ve made in our BCRs.  
				
ADP’s Global Chief Privacy Officer is charged with leading and overseeing ADP’s Global Privacy Programs, along with the members of the global privacy team. The global privacy team may be contacted at

An overview of the Global Data Privacy Policy, as it applies to Client Employee’s data that we process on behalf of our Clients, is located on this webpage.

					ADP commits to not provide your Personal Data to Third Parties for their own marketing purposes.  We limit our sharing of your Personal Data to:
				
ADP Group Companies, which will only use your Personal Data for the purposes listed above.
Our service providers, who are bound by law or contract to protect your Personal Data and only use your Personal Data in accordance with our instructions.
Our business partners, but only to the extent you have purchased product or service from such partner, interacted with such partner, or otherwise authorized the sharing.  For example, if you are referred to ADP from a business partner website, we may provide that partner with your contact information and certain economic and financial information, such as bank account information, to validate the referral. We may also provide your contact information to companies that offer complementary products and services if you request information about these solutions.
Enforce our rights, protect our property, or protect the rights, property or safety of others, or as needed to support external auditing, compliance and corporate governance functions.  We will also disclose Personal Data when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.

					Please note that we may also use and disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable.  For example, we may publish reports that contain aggregated, anonymized, and statistical data about our Clients.  These reports do not contain information that would enable the recipient to contact, locate or identify you.  These reports also do not contain identifiable company information.
				
5. Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies

					When you visit our website or use our mobile applications, we collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs, and web beacons. For example, when you visit our website, we place cookies on your computer. Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return. They also help us provide a customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud. In many cases, you can manage cookie preferences and opt-out of having cookies and other data collection technologies used by adjusting the settings on your browser. All browsers are different, so visit the “help” section of your browser to learn about cookie preferences and other privacy settings that may be available.
				

					ADP also uses flash cookies (also known as local stored objects) and similar technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience. The Adobe Flash Player is an application that allows rapid development of dynamic content, such as video clips and animation. We use flash cookies for security purposes and to help remember settings and preferences similar to browser cookies, but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. To manage flash cookies, please see Adobe’s website at 
https://adobe.ly/2Kn1NL2
 or visit 
www.adobe.com.
 ADP does not use flash cookies or similar technologies for behavioral or interest-based advertising purposes.
				

					Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
				

					We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we collect information from the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP address is a unique number that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to ADP and the website you visit after you leave our site.
				

					In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in a non-identifiable way, without reference to Personal Data. For example, we use information we collect about website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns. In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Data. This Privacy Statement applies to the information when we associate it with your Personal Data.
				

					Our website may include embedded YouTube videos. When you click on an embedded YouTube video that video is loaded from a domain operated by YouTube. Although we have enabled the Privacy-Enhanced mode for embedded YouTube videos, which prevents YouTube from placing tracking cookies on your device when viewing these videos on our site, YouTube may collect your IP address and other devices information for their own purposes.  To learn more about YouTube’s Privacy-Enhanced mode visit the YouTube support page at 
https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780.
 To learn more about YouTube’s processing of IP addresses visit YouTube’s privacy policy at 
https://policies.google.com/privacy.



					ADP has relationships with Third Party advertising companies to place advertisements on this website and other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for this website and other websites. These Third Party advertising companies may place cookies on your computer when you visit our website or other websites so they can display targeted advertisements to you. These Third Party advertising companies do not collect Personal Data in this process, and we do not give Personal Data to them as part of this process. This Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these vendors. For more information about Third Party advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at 
www.networkadvertising.org.
 You may opt out of being targeted by many Third Party advertising companies by visiting 
http://bit.ly/2Ig9IgT.

What online tracking technology does Capital One use?
We and third-party providers acting on our behalf use a variety of online tools and technologies to collect information when you visit or use the Online Services, including Device Data and Mobile/Online Activity Data. For example, we use these tools to collect information for debugging, fraud prevention, session management, and other necessary purposes. We also use these to conduct 
personalization, analytics, and targeted advertising
 on or through the Online Services. We may associate this tracking data with your Capital One account (if you have one).


These tools include:




Server logs.
 Server logs automatically record information and details about your online interactions with us. For example, server logs may record information about your visit to our website on a particular time and day.


Cookies
. Cookies are small text files that a website’s server stores in your web browser. Cookies allow companies to recognize your device and store information about your account and preferences. For example, we may use cookies to store information about pages visited on our sites, language preferences, your relationship with us, or other information that we have associated with you or your device. You may be able to 
manage cookies on your device
.


Pixel tags
. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon, clear GIF, pixel, or tag) is an image or a small string of code that may be placed in a website, advertisement, or email. It allows companies to set or read cookies or transfer information to their servers when you load a webpage or interact with online content. For example, we or our service providers may use pixel tags to determine whether you have interacted with a specific part of our website, viewed a particular advertisement, or opened a specific email.


SDKs and mobile advertising IDs
. Our mobile applications may include third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your mobile app activity. In addition, some mobile devices come with a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple’s IDFA and Google’s Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, allow us and our service providers to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes.


Third-party plugins
. Our Online Services may include plugins from other companies, including social media companies (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button). These plugins may collect information, such as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the company that created the plugin even if you do not click on the plugin. These third-party plugins are governed by the privacy policies and terms of the companies that created them.


How does Capital One use online tracking technology to conduct personalization, analytics, targeted advertising, and how can you opt out?
We and third-party providers acting on our behalf use 
online tracking technology
 to conduct personalization, analytics, and targeted advertising on or through the Online Services.




Personalization
. Capital One may customize content and advertisements for our products and services on our own and third-party websites and mobile apps. In order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, we may use the information we collect about you online, alone or in combination with information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts, transactional information, or the state in which you bank). We also use online tracking technologies to recognize your computer or device when you’re logged in, enable enhanced features or functionality, improve usability, and otherwise provide the Online Services to you.


Analytics
. We and our third-party providers use online tracking technologies to engage in data analytics, auditing, measurement, research, reporting, and debugging on our Online Services and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising. For example, we use Google Analytics on our Online Services for such purposes. You can 
learn more about Google Analytics here
 and 
opt out here
.




Targeted advertising
. We and our third-party providers may collect information about your activities on our Online Services and across different websites, mobile apps, and devices over time for targeted advertising purposes. These providers may then show you ads, including across the internet and mobile apps, and other devices, based in part on the information they have collected or that we have shared with them.


For example, when you visit the Capital One website and explore our products, our advertising providers may use that information to determine which ads to show you when you go to other, non-Capital One websites. Similarly, when you view a Capital One ad on your computer, our advertising providers may use that information when deciding whether to show you a subsequent ad on your laptop or mobile device. For more information about targeted advertising, please see the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) 
Understanding Online Advertising
 page.


You may 
opt out of certain targeted advertising
, as discussed below.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for 
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can 
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which 
ads you’ll find most useful
, 
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with 
unique identifiers
 tied to the browser, application, or 
device
 you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as 
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with 
personal information
 that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a 
phone number
 or 
payment information
 to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and 
devices
 you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes 
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including 
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and 
referrer URL
 of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an 
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your 
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, 
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve 
synced with your Google Account
If you use our 
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other 
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or 
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can 
turn your Android device’s location on or off
 using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on 
Location History
 if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about 
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from 
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to 
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide 
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including 
cookies
, 
pixel tags
, local storage, such as 
browser web storage
 or 
application data caches
, databases, and 
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to 
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to 
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to 
make improvements
 to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and 
customized search results
. For example, 
Security Checkup
 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you 
personalized ads
 based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in 
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on 
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to 
link information
 about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the 
safety and reliability
 of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or 
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us 
detect abuse
 such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use 
algorithms
 to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may 
combine the information we collect
 among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, 
your activity on other sites and apps
 may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in 
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you 
use Google Home to make a reservation
 through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to

For external processing
We provide personal information to our 
affiliates
 and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Meet any applicable law, regulation, 
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our 
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, 
our users
, or the public as required or permitted by law.
We may share 
non-personally identifiable information
 publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to 
show trends
 about the general use of our services. We also allow 
specific partners
 to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like 
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and 
2 Step Verification
 to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information

personal info
 or the content you create or upload, like 
photos
 and 
documents
. You can also delete 
activity information
 saved in your account, or 
choose to have it deleted automatically
 after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as 
advertising data

We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s 
data retention periods

Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain 
servers around the world
 and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain 
legal frameworks
 relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
U.S. state law requirements
Some 
U.S. state privacy laws
 require specific disclosures.
This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:
We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in 
Information Google collects
.
We explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in 
Why Google collects data
.
We explain when Google may disclose information in 
Sharing your information
. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
We explain how Google retains information in 
Retaining your information
. You can also learn more about 
how Google anonymizes data
. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.
U.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Finally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.
We describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google’s services in 
Your privacy controls
. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as 
export and download
 a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting 
My Ad Center
.
When you use these tools, we’ll validate your request by verifying that you’re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also 
contact Google
. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.
We also provide 
more information
 on Google’s handling of CCPA requests.

An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in ""local storage"" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about 
how Google uses cookies
 and how Google uses data, including cookies, 
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a 
Google Account
 and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about 
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
 is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
 is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
 is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
 is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about 
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be 
managed
 in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at 
My Activity

combine the information we collect
Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. 
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. 
Learn more

), carefully to understand how Starbucks collects, uses and discloses personally identifiable information from its users, including with respect to the Starbucks mobile application (“Application”). By downloading, installing, accessing or using the Application, you consent to all actions that we take with respect to your data consistent with our Privacy Policy and the following provisions.
Notice of Financial Incentive
Starbucks Rewards is one way in which Starbucks endeavors to reward and thank loyal customers for patronizing our business and purchasing Starbucks products. Starbucks Rewards members opt in by signing up for Rewards online or through the Starbucks App and are able to earn and accumulate ""Stars"" that can be redeemed for Starbucks Rewards benefits at participating Starbucks stores. Starbucks collects and uses the personal information described above, including information you voluntarily provide us (such as your name and email), information we collect automatically, and information from other sources to operate the Starbucks Rewards program, including to send you promotions, content, and special offers and the other uses described in this Privacy Statement. Starbucks does not assign monetary value for the information we collect through the Starbucks Rewards program when sending email communications. You may opt out of receiving commercial email communications at any time by adjusting your Starbucks online account settings as described in How to Manage Your Account Settings, or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included within any commercial email we send you. Participation in Starbucks Rewards is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the Starbucks Rewards program by visiting the Account section in the Starbucks iOS App, by requesting deletion of your information by filling out this form, or by calling Starbucks customer service. Based on our reasonable and good faith estimate, we receive value from Starbucks Rewards in increased customer loyalty and patronage, though any value will vary by Starbucks Rewards member depending on purchases made, which offers a member takes advantage of, and many other factors.

Intuit Global Privacy Statement
Last Updated: September 6, 2023
See previous Privacy Statements
Expand All
Collapse All
Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role
Intuit responsibly leverages technology to power prosperity around the world. We believe that everyone has a right to privacy. As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (
“Privacy Statement”
) to explain how we, Intuit Inc. and the 
Intuit group companies
 (collectively 
“Intuit,” “we,” “us,” or “our”
), collect, use, share, or otherwise process information that we collect through our services. These services include, as applicable, our websites, mobile applications, social media pages, marketing activities, and other activities described in this Privacy Statement, or when other businesses provide us your personal information (collectively, the 
“Services”
). This Privacy Statement is global, meaning it applies to all Intuit Services. We may provide additional or supplemental privacy statements for certain products or services.
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices when we process:
Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “
Tax Preparation Information
”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;
Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of our websites and the Intuit platform, which includes all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) other than Tax Preparation Information (the “
Intuit Platform
”); and
Personal information as necessary to manage, run, improve, and develop our business and personalize your experience while interacting with the Intuit Platform. Depending on your settings, this may include showing you personalized ads or recommending certain Intuit products based on your interests.
Intuit determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement, and therefore acts as a ‘data controller’ (or equivalent/similar terms under applicable data privacy laws) of such information. We may share your personal information within the 
Intuit group companies
 a
nd conduct processing activities as controllers or joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
In certain circumstances, there may be more than one data controller processing your personal information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as a data controller. In these situations, we act as an independent data controller over our processing activities. This means we determine how your personal information will be processed independently from the other data controllers. The other data controllers have their own obligations under applicable data privacy laws. Intuit is not responsible for other data controllers’ processing activities, and you should contact them directly for questions about how they process your personal information and about how to exercise your privacy rights in relation to such processing.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to certain processing activities where we are not the controller.  For example, where Intuit processes personal information as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, including when we process personal information on behalf of customers of our professional tax software products. When we act as a processor or service provider, the privacy statement of the customer who uses our Services applies, instead of this Privacy Statement, and our processing of such personal information is governed by our agreements with such customers. If you have concerns about personal information that we process on behalf of a customer, or wish to exercise your privacy rights regarding such personal information, please contact the customer directly. 
This Privacy Statement also does not apply to Intuit Financial Services or Intuit’s processing of education records subject to state or federal laws or children’s data in our education curriculum products.  You may find the privacy statement for Intuit Financial Services

If you have any questions about how Intuit processes your personal information, please see How to contact us below.
The Intuit platform
The Intuit Platform and your personal information
When we say “platform,” we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), Intuit uses that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you’re using. This means that, for example, we may use your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, budgets from Mint, contact and purchase history details from Mailchimp, and/or recommendations from Credit Karma. The personal information we use in this centralized way may relate to you as an end user of our Services or as a customer or vendor of an Intuit customer whose personal information has been included in the Intuit Platform.
Business account information
Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with a business (such as your employer). If you are granted access to a business account (for example, in QuickBooks), the business owner or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights; making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll); or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift). If the owner or designated administrator changes your access rights, then you may lose access to the information the business controls.
Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of a business account may be subject to the business’s policies, which may differ from this Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other businesses, and you should consider both the business’s policies and whether you are comfortable giving the business access to your personal information before connecting to their services.
Personal information we collect
The personal information that we collect or otherwise receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account, and the choices you make, including your privacy settings. The way we process your personal information may also depend on the particular Services, functionalities, or experiences you use, your location, and applicable law.
Information you provide to us
You may provide us with your information as follows:
Contact data and account profile data.
 We collect information when you (or your organization) create an account, activate a subscription, and/or upload information to the Intuit Platform. Personal information may include your name, previous name(s) and/or nicknames, title and honorifics, professional title and company name, education, billing and mailing addresses, phone number and email address, profile photo, billing information (your payment information), purchase history, demographic information, preferences, subscription data, and your username and account credentials.
Identity verification information.
 We collect information to verify your identity, including your name, date of birth, social security number, social insurance number, driver’s license number, passport number, government-issued identification details, and similar information to verify your identity and to help you file your tax return.
Communications, feedback and survey data, and related data. 
We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number and any other personal information you choose to share when you reach out to us for support, give us feedback, participate in optional surveys, attend our events, participate in product research or training, or otherwise interact or communicate with us. This information may include: call center recordings and call monitoring records, chat and text records, voicemails, photographs, and video images.

Interactions with experts.
 The Intuit Platform provides many opportunities for you to connect with live experts, including, for example, accountants or tax preparers. When you interact with these experts, we may receive information about the questions you ask, the details of your accounts, and the guidance provided to you.
Interactions with chatbots.
 We may receive information from you through your use of chatbots, digital assistants, or other interactive bots across the Intuit Platform.
Device and contact data.
 If you grant permission in your device settings, certain features may have access to your device and contacts.
Third-party sources
The Intuit Platform is designed to help you connect with other people and businesses. As a result of those connections, others may be able to input personal information about you, including other customers using the Intuit Platform. For example, an Intuit customer may share personal information about you with us in order to use and benefit from the Intuit Platform. You also may be able to input or process personal information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator of one of our products or use Intuit to manage customer lists. If you input information about others into the Platform, you must only do so if you have first provided sufficient notice and received any required permissions, and have an appropriate legal basis if required by applicable law.
We may also receive personal information about you from other third parties where you have provided consent or where permitted by applicable law. We protect and process the personal information obtained from those third parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. Our third-party sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the Intuit Platform. For example, we receive information from:
Linked third-party services.
 If you choose to sync a non-Intuit account/service with your Intuit account, we will receive information from that account/service according to your settings with that account/service. This may include details of your bank account information, social media information, purchase history or your business’s sales records through a point of sale application.  
Supplemental information and identity verification providers.
 We work with certain third parties to help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business, and/or supplement the personal information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your personal information. For example, we use third-party providers to validate your contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address, phone number) or to provide additional details about your business. These providers may include, for example, your financial institution, telecommunications provider, or email provider.
Customer support providers.
 We receive personal information about you or your interaction with the Intuit Platform from certain third parties for troubleshooting purposes. For example, we may obtain information about your interaction(s) with customer support and information about technical issues you have raised, including call center recordings, call monitoring records, voicemails, photographs and chat records.
Credit bureaus and related third parties.
 Many Intuit features rely on information we receive from credit bureaus and related third parties. For example, in some countries, we may offer free credit reports and credit scores. We request these reports and credit scores on your behalf from credit bureau partners, like TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. These partners may also provide personal information such as employment or income data, social security number, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so we can make more personalized recommendations for you. 
Other users.
 As described above, we may receive personal information about you from other Intuit Platform users, such as your accountant, bookkeeper, tax preparer, spouse, employer, or other business customers using the Intuit Platform (e.g., businesses from which you buy products or services, or with which you otherwise interact). We may also collect such personal information through features like member referral programs.
Risk management, cybersecurity & anti-fraud providers.
 We may receive personal information from third parties that help us assess risks associated with our offerings, including to help combat fraud and illegal activity and to help protect your personal information.
Data providers.
 We may receive information from information services and data licensors that provide demographic and preference information to us.
Content providers.
 We may receive personal information from companies that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.
Joint offering partners.
 We may offer co-branded services or experiences or engage in joint-marketing activities with others, including through our conferences or live events.
Government agencies.
 We receive information from government agencies, including from various tax agencies, such as your tax filing confirmation from the IRS.

Automatic data collection
We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log personal information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Services, such as:
Device information.
 We may collect information about your device(s) such as IP addresses, log information, error messages, device type, and unique device identifiers. For example, we may collect IP addresses from you as part of our sign in and security features. 
Usage information.
 We may collect information about your use of the Intuit Platform, such as the pages you viewed, the services and features you used or interacted with, your browser type, and details about any links or communications with which you interacted.
Location information.
 Certain features in the Intuit Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion information, or both, if you or your organization grant(s) us permission to do so through your device settings (for example, if you use QuickBooks’ time-tracking service, participate in Karma Drive, or use CK Money to locate nearby ATMs).
Information stored locally.
 Some of our web-enabled desktop services and offerings synchronize with the information on your computer. In doing so, we may collect information such as device information, product usage, and error reports. We may also store personal information locally on your device.
Communication interaction data.
 We or our third-party service providers may collect information from email providers, communication providers and social networks, such as your interactions with our email, text or other communications (e.g., whether you open and/or forward emails) – we may do this through use of pixel tags (which are also known as clear GIFs), which may be embedded invisibly in our emails.
Online behavioral data
. We may automatically collect certain personal information about your use and interactions with our websites, customers’ websites or e-commerce stores, social media websites, and marketing campaigns that we or our customers organize, including device information (such as your IP address and unique device IDs), page view information and search results, links, and if you are a customer contact, whether or not a campaign presented or sent to you using our offerings has been viewed, delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it has bounced or was treated as spam.
Cookies and similar technologies
Intuit and our service providers may use commonly used tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local shared objects and similar technologies (collectively “cookies”) to collect information about you (“
Cookie Information
”) so we can provide the experiences you request, recognize your visit, track your interactions, and improve your and other customers’ experiences. For example, we may use session-replay technologies,
 
such as those provided by FullStory and Medallia, that employ software code to record users’ interactions with the Services in a manner that allows us to watch video replays of those user sessions. The replays include users’ clicks, mobile app touches, mouse movements, scrolls and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement. You can learn more about FullStory at 
https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy-policy

Verification
To help protect privacy and the security of your personal information, you may be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity and/or ownership rights before we can fulfill your data rights request. If we cannot verify your identity or your ownership rights to the data, we may not be able to service your request until you provide proper documentation.

Even if you submit a deletion request, we may be required to maintain your personal information for as long as necessary to:
comply with our legal or regulatory compliance needs (e.g., maintaining records of transactions you have made with us);

International data transfers
Unless you have provided us with consent to transfer your personal information, US Tax Preparation Information shall be processed and stored in the United States in accordance with applicable law.
With the exception noted above, Intuit reserves the right to store and process your personal information in the United States and in any other country where Intuit or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities in accordance with and as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
When we transfer, store or process personal information outside of your jurisdiction (including to or in the United States, as described above), we take appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law.
Some of these recipients of your personal information are located in countries for which the European Commission and/or UK Government (as and where applicable) have issued adequacy decisions, which means that these countries are recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under applicable UK and/or European data protection laws and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Other recipients of your personal information are located in countries outside the EEA and/or the UK that are not the subject of an adequacy decision. In these cases, we may use the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or, as may be applicable, the International Data Transfer Agreement approved by the UK Government, to help ensure your personal information is protected. For more information on the transfer safeguards we rely on, please contact us by using the details in the “How to contact us” section below. 
Intuit (excluding Credit Karma) and Mailchimp comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland to the United States. Intuit and Mailchimp rely on the EU-U.S. DPF to transfer data and will rely on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF once approved by the appropriate authorities.

Opt-out of Sales and/or Sharing. 
Like many companies, Intuit and Mailchimp use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you as described above. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may classify our use of some of these services as “sharing” your Personal Information with the advertising partners that provide the services. You can opt-out of the “sharing” of your personal information by visiting the “Your California Privacy Rights” link in the footer of the Intuit website. 
In addition, if you have enabled a recognized opt-out mechanism on your browser, device, or platform, you will automatically be opted out of any “sharings” when you interact with our Services beginning on January 1, 2023. Please go here to learn more about enabling one such preference signal, the Global Privacy Control: 
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download
. Intuit and Mailchimp do not sell personal information under the CCPA. Credit Karma does not sell or share personal information subject to the CCPA, and therefore does not offer a “Your California Privacy Rights” link on its website. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
Limit processing of sensitive personal information.
 We only use sensitive personal information as necessary for our (1) Service delivery and operations, (2) compliance and protection, (3) research and development, or (4) Service improvement and analytics purposes in accordance with CCPA. If we use sensitive personal information outside the permitted purposes of CCPA, we will provide you with the right to limit processing of sensitive personal information.
Non-discrimination
. You have the right to be free from discrimination or retaliation related to your exercise of any of your California privacy rights.
Verification.
 In order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or deletion, we may require you to verify your credentials before you can submit a rights request. If you do not have an account with us, or if we suspect your account has been accessed without your authorization, we may ask you to provide additional personal information for verification. For Credit Karma members, we may require that you confirm certain pieces of personal information that we have on file and/or log into your Credit Karma account. If we are subsequently unable to confirm your identity, we may refuse your rights request.
Authorized agents.
 You may use an authorized agent to submit a rights request. If you do so, the authorized agent must present signed written authorization to act on your behalf, and you will also be required to independently verify your own identity directly with us and confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the rights request. This verification process is not necessary if your authorized agent provides documentation showing that the authorized agent has power of attorney to act on your behalf under Cal. Prob. Code §§ 4121 to 4130.

Our Commitment To You
At Tinder, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful connections.
We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly.
Our commitment to privacy.
 We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to make sure that our decisions are taken with the utmost respect for your privacy.
Our commitment to transparency.
 Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we’re doing our best to write our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!
Our commitment to security.
 We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.
Welcome to our Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.
If you are a California resident, please see our 
California Privacy Statement
, which supplements this Privacy Policy.
We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
This Privacy Policy applies from July 1, 2023. The 
previous version of this Privacy Policy
 applies until then.

 2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies
This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the Tinder brand. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.
Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
 
3. Information We Collect
It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information about your use of our services such as access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through your social media account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your profile. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
Information you give us
You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:
When you create an account, you provide us with at least your phone number and email address, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender, date of birth, and who you ’d like to connect with.
When you complete your profile, you have the option to share your sexual orientation with us. Where you provide such elements to us, you consent to us using it for the purposes identified and as laid out in this Privacy Policy. You can also share additional information with us, such as details on your bio and your interests, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.
When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us with information related to the purchases you make and our payment processors with information such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.
When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.
When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.
If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction.
If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a given feature), we process this information on your behalf in order to complete your request.
Of course, we also process your chats with other members as well as the content you publish to operate and secure the services, and to keep our community safe.
Information we receive from others
In addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:
Members:
 Members may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.
Social Media:
 You may decide to share information with us through your social media account, for instance if you decide to create and log into your account via your social media or other account (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or to upload onto our services information such as photos from one of your social media accounts (e.g., Instagram or Spotify).
Affiliates:
 We are part of the 
Match Group family of businesses
. Match Group considers the safety and security of members a top priority. If you were banned from another Match Group service, your information can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our services. 
Other Partners:
 We may receive information about you from our partners where our ads are published on a partner’s service (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success). Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our members’ safety and security.
Information generated or automatically collected when you use our services
When you use our services, this generates technical data about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details.
Usage Information:
 Using the services generates data about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., when you logged in, features you’ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other members (e.g., members you connect and interact with, and when you matched and exchanged messages with them).
Device information:
 We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings and, in some cases, disable entirely), and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.
Information collected by cookies and similar technologies:
 We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, SDKs) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our 
Cookie Policy
 for more information on why we use them and how you can better control their use.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including ours, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
Other information with your consent:
Precise geolocation data:
 If you give us your consent, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) from your device. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your precise geolocation, we will not collect it, and our services that rely on precise geolocation may not be available to you.
Photo Verification
 
data:
 If you choose to participate in our Photo Verification feature, we collect your face geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions, to verify that you’re the real you. You can 
learn more about Photo Verification
 and how we process your face geometry data.
ID + Photo Verification data:
 If you choose to participate in our combined ID + Photo Verification feature, we collect your face geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions, as well as a copy of your ID, to verify that you’re the real you. You can 
learn more about ID + Photo Verification
 and how we process your data.
Other information:
 We may collect other information with your permission, such as photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo or video or participate in streaming features on our services).
 
4. How We Use Information
The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you and our community safe, and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you. Read on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons for which we use your information, together with practical examples.

G. To ensure legal compliance

Assist law enforcement
For information on how we process personal information through profiling and automated decision-making, please see our 
FAQ
.
To process your information as described in this Privacy Policy, we rely on the following legal bases:
Provide our service to you: The reason we process your information for purposes A, B and C above is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, make it viewable to other members and recommend other members to you and to otherwise provide our free and paid features to you and other members.
Legitimate interests: We process your information for purposes D, E and F above, based on our legitimate interest. For instance, we analyze users’ behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you and promote our own services, we process information to help keep our members safe and we process data where necessary to enforce our rights, assist law enforcement and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a legal action.
Comply with applicable laws and regulations: We process your information for purpose G above where it is necessary for us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and evidence our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we retain traffic data and data about transactions in line with our accounting, tax and other statutory data retention obligations and to be able to respond to valid access requests from law enforcement. We also keep data evidencing consents members give us and decisions they may have taken to opt-out of a given feature or processing.
Consent: If you choose to provide us with information that may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, such as your sexual orientation, you’re consenting to our processing of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may ask for your consent to collect specific information such as your precise geolocation or use your information for certain specific reasons. In some cases, you may withdraw your consent by adapting your settings (for instance in relation to the collection of our precise geolocation) or by deleting your content (for instance where you entered information in your profile that may be considered “special” or “sensitive”). In any case, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
 
5. How We Share Information
Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of members’ information is, of course, with other members. We also share some types of  members’ information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies for specified reasons as laid out below and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.
With other members
You share information with other members when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being visible.
If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.
If someone submits a report involving you (such as a claim you violated our 
Terms of Use
), we may communicate to the reporter actions, if any, we took as a result of their report.
With our service providers and partners
We use vendors to help us operate, distribute, market and improve our services, such as data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations. We also share information with vendors who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising vendors.
We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any vendor or working with any partner. Our vendors and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.
With our affiliates
We are part of the 
Match Group family of businesses
. We share your information with affiliates for limited legitimate purposes as laid out below:
To make all Match Group platforms safer and enable us to address (e.g., ban) bad actors found on one platform also on the others
For them to assist us in data processing operations, as processors / service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf. Their assistance may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, analytics, finance and accounting assistance, improving our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings
We may also share information with other Match Group companies for other legitimate business purposes including corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting, where and as allowed under applicable law
Sharing functionality
You may choose to share other members’ profiles and they may share yours with people outside of our services, using the sharing functionality.
For corporate transactions
We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.
With law enforcement / when required by law
We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
To enforce legal rights
We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our members, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
With your consent or at your request
We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.
We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, location in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our 
Cookie Policy
 
6. Cross-Border Data Transfers
Sharing of information laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. When we transfer personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries which data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental body, we use 
standard contract clauses
 (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or other appropriate transfer mechanism. We are currently in the process of reviewing transfers to our vendors and associated legal basis further to the 
recent Court of Justice for the European Union’s ruling on transfers of personal data to the USA
.
 
7. Your Rights and Choices
We want you to be in control of your information, so we want to remind you of the following options and tools available to you:
Access / Update tools in the service.
 Tools and account settings can help you access, rectify or remove information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any questions on those tools and settings, please 
contact our customer care team
 for help
.
Device permissions.
 Mobile platforms can have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone contacts, pictures, location services, push notifications and advertising identifiers. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection or processing of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose functionality.
Uninstall.
 You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. Remember that uninstalling an app does NOT close your account. To close your account, please use the corresponding functionality on the service.
Account closure.
 You can close your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.
We also want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:
Access/know.
 You may have the right to request a copy of the information we keep about you, and in certain circumstances to receive this in a portable format. You can exercise your right to access directly within the service by 
putting in a request.
Delete/erase.
 You may request that we delete the personal information we keep about you. You can exercise your right to delete by 
submitting a request
.
Correct/rectify/update.
 You can correct most information you provided to us by editing your profile directly in the service. If you believe the information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may 
contact us
 to rectify it.
Object/restrict.
 You may also have the right to object to or request that we restrict certain processing. To do so, please 
contact us
.
For your protection and the protection of all of our members, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another member, such as a copy of any messages you received from them through our service, the other member will have to contact us to provide their written consent before the information is released. We may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot ensure that you are 18 years of age or older.
If you are a resident of Virginia, Colorado, or Connecticut, USA, if we deny your privacy request, you may be able to appeal by 
contacting us
, and explicitly referencing “Privacy Request Appeal.” If you have concerns about the result of your appeal you may contact the attorney general for your state.  Additionally, please note that we do not “sell” your personal data, or use it for “targeted advertising” or “profiling” in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, as those terms are defined by applicable law in your state, so no opt-out choice is necessary.
In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area 
here
, and in the United Kingdom 
here
. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.
 
8. How Long We Retain Your Information
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services, you can close your account and your profile will stop being visible to other members. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for a period of two years. After your account is closed, we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:
To protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure, or one year following an account ban. During this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.
Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below:
a) We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the duration the user may challenge the transaction and “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents members give us for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law.
b) We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as imprecise location of download/purchase for five years to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, information on the existence of past accounts and subscriptions, which we delete three years after the closure of your last account to ensure proper and accurate financial forecasting and reporting, profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account, for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.
c) Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings).
 
9. No Children Allowed
Our services are restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a member is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.
 
10. Job Candidates, Contractors and Vendor Representatives
We process the personal information of our job candidates, contractors and vendor representatives, as part of our recruitment and talent management operations and our management of the services that contractors and vendors provide to us. If you are a job candidate, contractor or vendor representative of ours, certain relevant terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your personal information, including the sections of this Privacy Policy that discuss the 
entity that is responsible for the processing of your personal information
, 
transfers of personal information
, 
rights you may have under applicable law
, 
how to contact us
 and 
California-specific information
.
If you are a job applicant, the personal information we process about you may vary depending on the job you seek but typically includes what you provide to us as part of your job application as well as professional qualifications, background and reference information that recruiters or other third parties share with us. We use this information to support the recruitment process, which may lead to an employment contract. For contractors and vendor representatives, we may process identification information and work-related information, as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer, which is necessary for the performance of the services agreement, and to establish, exercise or defend potential legal claims. We may share personal information with service providers that assist us with recruitment and technical data processing operations as well as with Match Group companies (for instance if you have a business relationship with employees of an affiliate). We keep your personal information only as long as necessary for those purposes.
 
11. Privacy Policy Changes
Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations about our data practices remain up-to-date, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.

‍

California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
This section of our Privacy Policy provides California residents with a comprehensive description of PrizePicks’ online and offline practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of personal information and the rights of California consumers regarding their personal information that is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) or any amendments or acts thereto upon their effective dates. The section will not apply, however, if PrizePicks does not collect any personal information about you or if all of the information we collect is exempt from the statute (for example, the CCPA does not protect information that is already protected by certain other privacy laws, and it does not protect information that is already publicly available). “Personal Information,” for purposes of this section regarding the rights of California consumers, means, identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household and does not include de-identified or aggregate information or publicly available information.
‍
Rights under CCPA
‍
Under CCPA, consumers have certain rights regarding their Personal Information, as described below.
‍
Right of Access
: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the following information about you, limited to the preceding twelve (12) months:
      o The categories of Personal Information that we collected about you;
      o The categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected;
      o The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal Information;
      o The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information;
      o The specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you;
      o The categories of Personal Information that we disclosed about you for a business purpose or sold to third-parties; and
      o For each category of Personal Information identified, the categories of third parties to whom the information was disclosed or sold.
Right of Deletion
: You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information about you which we have collected from you, subject to exceptions within the law.
Right to Opt-Out
: You have the right to opt-out of the disclosure of Personal Information about you for monetary or other valuable consideration. However, we do not sell or share any Personal Information for monetary payments. However, like many companies we do use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and we may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use. Because the definitions of ‘Personal Information,’ ‘share,’ and ‘sale’ under the California law are broad, making Personal Information available to these companies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under CCPA. You can opt out of such “sale” or “sharing” here: Do Not Sell or Share My Information. You may also contact us by using the Contact Us section below with a reference to “CCPA.”
Right to Opt-In
: We do not knowingly collect, share, or sell Personal Information of individuals under the age of 18.
Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
: You may request specific limitations on further sharing, use, or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information that is collected or processed for purposes outside of those permissible under the CCPA.
Right to Correction
: You have the right to request that we maintain accurate Personal Information about you and correct any Personal Information about you which we have collected from you, subject to exceptions within the law.
‍
If you would like to exercise your rights, please refer to the Consumer Requests and Verification section below with a reference to “CCPA.”
‍
Right to Non-Discrimination: We may not discriminate against you because you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, including, but not limited to:
      o Denying goods or services to you;
      o Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
      o Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you; or
      o Suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
‍
Authorized Representatives
‍
You may designate an authorized agent to request any of the above rights on your behalf. You may make such a designation by providing the agent with written permission, signed by you, to act on your behalf. Your agent may contact us as described in the Contact Us section below to make a request on your behalf. Even if you choose to use an agent, we may, as permitted by law, require:
‍
The authorized agent to provide proof that you provided signed permission to the authorized agent to submit the request;
You to verify your identity directly with us; or
You to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
‍
Selling, Sharing, and Disclosing Personal Information
‍
We do not sell or share your Personal Information in exchange for monetary consideration. However, the definitions of Personal Information, ‘share,’ and ‘sale’ under CCPA are broad. Like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads and personalization to you, which may involve transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use, such as Google Analytics. Because the definitions of ‘Personal Information,’ ‘share,’ and ‘sale’ under CCPA are broad, making Personal Information available to these companies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under CCPA. Because of the breadth of these definitions under CCPA, we have provided opt-out links. You have the right to direct us not to sell or share your Personal Information. You may exercise your opt-out rights by contacting us using a method listed in the Contact Us section.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHARING (FOR CROSS-CONTEXT BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING) OR SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Some information that we disclose to third parties may constitute the “sale” of your personal information or “sharing” of your personal information (for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes) under applicable laws. For instance, some of our brands disclose certain device identifiers and advertising identifiers associated with your mobile or internet-connected device to advertising partners. Those partners use and share those identifiers to show advertisements that are targeted to your interests.
Where a brand does this or otherwise “sells” your personal information, we will give you the opportunity to opt out by clicking the ‘Your Privacy Choices’ link on the footer of the relevant website, or in the settings menu of the relevant mobile or online application, or other service. If you submit an opt-out request, you will still see ads on our services, though they might be less relevant to you. These ads may be based on historical information or information “shared” or “sold” by other sources. Please note that, when you use these tools on our services, you may need to renew your choices each time you clear your cookies or use a new browser or device. You may also need to make this choice separately for some of our services. You also can update your browser settings to make certain choices about third-party cookies.
The following types of personal information may be “shared” with or “sold” to (and may have been “shared” with or “sold” to in the 12-month period prior to the last modified date of the privacy policy) advertising partners, analytics providers, and marketing partners:

Commercial information:
 Information about transactions or content choices made on or in connection with our services.

 Information related to your preferences, attitudes, online behaviors, demographics, and product and ad choices, and preferences.
Geolocation data:
 Information related to your location, including your IP address.
Internet / electronic activity:
 Information collected through cookies and web beacons; device attributes; customer preferences and attributes, such as likes, interests, social media statuses and updates, pictures, and references to your online presence.
We do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” personal information of individuals under the age of 16.
Do Not Track
. Our websites and apps are not designed to respond to “do not track” requests from browsers.
“Shine the Light” and “Eraser” Laws
. Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to whom we have disclosed certain information during the preceding year for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a registered user of a service where this policy is posted, you may request removal of content or information you have publicly posted. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete removal from the internet of the content or information you posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal. For all requests under the “Shine the Light” or “Eraser” Law, please visit our 
Privacy Rights Center
 and complete the form relevant to your relationship with Paramount and select ‘California’ as your state. We will only accept requests to exercise these rights through this mechanism.

Each time you use a PlayStation console or a PlayStation app on a PlayStation console or other devices (such as a mobile phone or PC), we may automatically collect information about your use of that device and app. If you sign into an Account, we may combine it with other information we have for that Account.


The information that we collect from devices may include:

Each time you sign into PlayStation Network and access our Services, we may automatically:




Collect information about your use of PlayStation Network Services on your device.


Log your activity on our PlayStation Network servers. For example, we may receive device and Account identifiers, such as your PlayStation Network Online ID and Account ID.

Collect information about your use of that game on your device (including for offline games, which may include information about the use of the game offline).

Information We Receive from Third Parties


We may receive information, including the following, from third party sources and combine it with information we already directly collect from you. We will handle the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.




Game, social media, or other information, from those third parties or services you link your Account with, or who provide information to power PlayStation Network features.


Information from other users, for example if those users have given us access to their profiles and if you are one of their connections, or information about you is otherwise made accessible to us by them.

However, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to monitor (including through the use of technology that automatically detects images, text, and URLs that breach our Terms of Service) and record your online activity and communication throughout PlayStation Network and to remove and/or delete any content.

Marketing and Advertising


We may target and personalize our marketing communications, purchase recommendations and advertisements that we display on our and third-party websites and services based on the information we have collected about you. You may notice this personalization on the PlayStation Store (whether via console, website or in-game), in marketing communications, or when you visit our and third-party websites (such as social network sites) that show purchase recommendations or advertisements from us.  You have options to control our use of information we have collected about you to personalize marketing to you, and can learn more about them in the Choices section of this Privacy Policy.

Other Users


When you create an Account, certain information will form part of your public profile and we will make it accessible to all accounts on PlayStation Network, on the Internet via playstation.com, and some third-party websites, apps or services. This information includes:




Your PlayStation Network Online ID


""About Me"" statement, avatar, language, country and gaming scores and statistics


Content you have shared




You are responsible for any content you share on forums, communities, chat and messaging features. This content will be accessible to other users who can then share that information further. We recommend you consider carefully what you share and with whom you share your information. We may also index and use content which you have shared publicly, as part of our platform’s features like Game Help, PlayStation profiles, or future PlayStation Network services.


Government Authorities


We may share your information with police and other government authorities if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal process, to detect, protect and enforce the safety of any person, their property or their rights, to address fraud and security and report criminal activity. The majority of the cases in which we have shared information with police and government authorities concern their investigations into stolen devices, unauthorized use of payment methods, or moderation purposes and safety of PlayStation Network and its users. In a small number of cases, we have also provided information in response to anti-fraud or more serious criminal investigations.


Information Handling and Your Choices


Children’s Information


We are committed to respecting children's privacy. We will not collect PI from anyone we have actual knowledge is under the age of 13, without a parent's consent. We do not share the PI of children who we have actual knowledge are under the age of 16 for delivery of advertising purposes. If you are creating an account for your child, we recommend that you and your child read our Privacy Information for Young Players to help them understand how we handle their PI and their rights over their PI.


With parental consent, we will collect, use and share information collected from or about children in accordance with the practices described in this document, with the following exceptions.


Information You Provide to Us




A parent only needs to provide limited information about their child (an email address and date-of-birth) to create an Account for their child. Providing gender is optional.


Only with the parent's approval to create an Account for the child, can a child add their address.


The spending limit of the Account for your child is set by the associated parent's Account.




Information You May Choose to Share




A parent can control, through the “Free Communication” setting on their child's Account, their child's ability to use (and share PI through) text chat, voice chat, video chat, and other messaging features from communicating directly with other users in games, apps or via system software features. Please note that a child's Account can still (1) Send and receive predetermined text messages created by a game or app, (2) Create and see other users' in-game character names, designs, and clan titles, (3) Use communication services via an Internet browser unless specifically disabled, and (4) Communicate via system messaging on PS3 and PS Vita.


A parent can control their child's ability to post or view user-generated content, including photos, videos, drawings, and content imported from outside sources (any of which might contain PI) through the user-generated content control. This will not prevent video capture of a child Account user's online gameplay.


A parent can agree to our collection and use of their child's PI without consenting to our disclosure to third parties, except when the disclosure is inherent to the Services we are providing.




When a parent allows their child's Account to participate in games, chat or user-generated content features, they also consent to SIE sharing information with the publishers of the games, applications, or services that incorporate those features and the collection of information entered into such features by the child's Account (e.g. typing text into the chat feature).


If you discover your child under the age of 13 has provided PI to us without your consent, once we verify you are the child's parent, we will promptly: (a) provide direct notice to you indicating what, if any PI of your child has been collected and how it has been used or disclosed; (b) remove and cease the use of your child's PI or other information from our database and (c) by notice to you, confirm compliance with the foregoing.


International Transfers


Our Services are operated in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries/areas/regions around the world. Please be aware that information we collect, including PI, will be transferred to, processed and stored in these countries/areas/regions and, as such, courts, law enforcement, and other authorities in these countries may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access your PI. We ensure there are adequate safeguards in place when transferring your information outside your country by entering contracts with the recipients, European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses or otherwise that the transfer only occurs where permitted by applicable law. By using our Services or providing us with any information through them, you acknowledge this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in these countries in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen.


Security and Retention


We seek to maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures that conform to industry standards to help protect your information against unauthorized or accidental disclosure, access, misuse, loss, or alteration. Although we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. There is no such thing as perfect security.


We advise you to make use of the enhanced account access controls that we make available such as 2-Step Verification. Please visit www.playstation.com and/or contact PlayStation Help and Support if you need any assistance in restricting access to your devices or accounts.


Please keep any passwords and passcodes for your devices and accounts safe and do not disclose them to anyone else. Consider ensuring automatic account log-in setting is disabled and the setting requiring a password to be entered before completing purchases is enabled, particularly if your PlayStation device is shared with others. You should contact PlayStation Support immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your accounts or other security breaches.


We may retain information about you as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. In addition, we may retain your information for an additional period as is permitted or required to, among other things, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Where required by applicable law, we shall delete your information when the information is no longer necessary or requested to do so. Even if we delete your information from active databases, the information may remain on backup or archival media as well as other information systems.


Your Choices and Rights


Your Choices


You may have certain choices about how your information is collected, used, stored, and shared.  These options can be accessed through your Account or device settings.  Please ensure that your information is up-to-date. Among others, you have the following choices:

Note that we will always slightly customize what you see (e.g. to avoid displaying content you've already purchased from the PlayStation Store), and some older devices (e.g. PS3/Vita), apps and games may still show some commercial personalization.


Personalized communications: Whether we may use the information we have collected, to personalize emails and notifications.


Limited Data/Service Data and Full Data/Advanced Data collection: Whether we may collect only the Limited Data necessary to provide our Services, or Full Data to enable a richer experience.

Your Rights


In addition to the rights described below, you can also access, amend or delete some information through your Account Settings page.




Request to Access and Correct: You have the right to request that we inform you of the PI we hold about you, as well as to request the correction of any inaccurate information about you.

Following your request for deletion, please be aware that the information that we collect about you may still be retained for legal, accounting, business continuity (backup), anti-fraud and community reasons.




In some cases, your choices to provide, change or delete information may affect our ability to deliver our Services, or your user experience. We may decline to process requests which are not otherwise required by applicable law. You have the right not to be unlawfully discriminated against because you have exercised these rights.

After you submit a request, we will require you to confirm your request, and verify your identity by requesting details of your account, devices, payment instruments or past transactions. We reserve the right to deny your requests if we cannot verify your identity.

Privacy Policy


Last updated: May 13
th
, 2020


Welcome



            Security and privacy are at the heart of what we do. Accordingly, we think it’s important to be transparent about what we do with your information and how we handle it.  This Privacy Policy describes how we process and handle data provided to us in connection with your use of our products, services, apps, and websites that link to this policy (we refer to these collectively as our “
services
”).
        



            This policy uses the term “
personal data
” to refer to information that is related to an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law.
        


Who are we?


This policy covers the data processing practices of VPN Super Inc., Free VPN Pte. 
Ltd,
 and Mobile Jump Pte. 
Ltd.


In this policy, “we,” “us,” and “our” refers to the
particular company from the list above that provides you with the services and
is responsible for handling your data in accordance with this policy. For mobile
apps, you can identify which company this is by looking at which company is
listed as offering the app on the download page for that app or reviewing its
terms of service. 






1. What information do we collect about you?






This section describes the various types of information
we collect from and about you. This information is not collected in all
situations, but only in specific situations. To understand the context in which
collection occurs, see Section 2 (How do we use your information?). More information
about some of the mechanisms we use to collect this information, such as
cookies, is available in Section 4 (Tracking Technologies & Cookies).


1.1. Information you provide to us


●
      
Account
information.
 Some services require or allow you to create an
account before you can access them. As part of registering for an account, we
may collect information such as your name, username, email address, and
password.


●
      
Billing
and payment information.
 In order to purchase a service, you may
need to provide to us with details such as billing name, billing contact
details (street addresses, email addresses), and payment instrument details.


●
      
Identity
verification information.
 Some services require you to verify
your identity as part of creating an account to access them. We may collect
information such as email addresses for this purpose.


●
      
Communications
and submissions.
 You may choose to provide us with
information when you communicate with us (e.g. via email for support or to
inquire about our services), including when you fill out an online form,
respond to surveys, provide feedback, participate in promotions, or submit
information through our services.


1.2. Information collected when you use our services


●
      
Usage
information.
 We collect information about how you interact with
our services, such as how much bandwidth you use, and when and for how long you
use our services.


●
      
Device
information.
 
We collect
information from and about the device you use to access our services. For
example, we may collect device identifiers, browser types, device types and
settings, operating system versions, mobile, wireless, and other network
information (such as internet service provider name, carrier name and signal
strength), and application version numbers.


●
      
Diagnostic
information.
 We may collect information about the nature of the
requests that you make to our servers (such as what is being requested,
information about the device and app used to make the request, timestamps, and
referring URLs). However, we do not log any information that associates your
identity with your VPN browsing activity. We do not maintain any records that
show what you were browsing or accessing through a VPN connection. 


●
      
Location
information.
 We may collect your location information based on a
variety of sources, such as your device’s GPS or by calculating an approximate
latitude and longitude based on your IP address.


1.3. Information provided to us by third parties


●
      
Referrals.
 If you
are invited to use our service, the person who invited you may submit your
personal data, such as your email address or other contact information.


●
      
Third Party
Accounts. 
Some services may allow you to register an account using
a third party account (such as a Google or Microsoft account). If you do so,
that third party may send us some information about you that they have. You may
be able to control what information they send us via your privacy settings for
that third party account.






●


      




Threat Information.








 




We may receive
information from reputable members of the security industry who provide
information to help us to provide, develop, test, and improve our services (for
example, lists of malicious URLs, spam blacklists, phone number blacklists, and
sample malware). Some of this information may contain personal data on an
incidental basis.






You generally do not have a duty to disclose personal
data to us unless you have a contractual obligation to us to do so. However, we
need to collect and process certain information that is necessary or legally
required in order to provide the services to you or otherwise perform our
contractual relationships with you.
            






We use the information we collect for various purposes described below.




●
      
To

provide, maintain, troubleshoot, and support our services.
 We use
your information for this purpose on the basis that it is required to fulfill
our contractual obligations to you. Examples: using information about how much
bandwidth you use and how long you use our services in order to provide the
services in accordance with a plan to which you have subscribed; using threat
and device information to determine whether certain items pose a potential
security threat; using location information to connect you to the nearest and
fastest VPN server; and using usage information to troubleshoot a problem you
report with our services and to ensure the proper functioning of our services.


●
      
For
 billing
and payment purposes. 
We use your information in order to
perform billing administration activities and process payments, which are
required to fulfill our contractual obligations.


●
      
To

communicate with users and prospective users. 
We use your
information to communicate with you, including by responding to your requests,
and sending you information and updates about our services. We may do this in
order to fulfill our contract with you, because you consented to the
communication, or because we have a legitimate interest in providing you with
information about our services.


●
      
To
 improve
our services. 
We want to offer you the best services and user
experiences we can, so we have a legitimate interest in continually improving
and optimizing our services. To do so, we use your information to understand
how users interact with our services. Examples: we analyze certain usage,
device, and diagnostic information to understand aggregated usage trends and
user engagement with our services (and, for example, invest in technical
infrastructure to better serve regions with increasing user demand); we may use
device and threat information to conduct spam, threat, and other scientific
research to improve our threat detection capabilities; we review customer
feedback to understand what we could be doing better.


●
      
To
 develop
new services.
 We have a legitimate interest in using your information
to plan for and develop new services. For example, we may use customer feedback
to understand what new services users may want.


●
      
To
 market
and advertise our services. 
We may use your information to 
provide,
 measure, personalize, and enhance our advertising
and marketing based on our legitimate interest in offering you services that
may be of interest. Examples: we may use information such as 
who

or what referred you to our services to understand how effective our
advertising is; we may use information to administer promotional activities
such as sweepstakes and referral programs. Our VPN products do not use your VPN
browsing activity for these purposes and we do not maintain any records that
show what you were browsing or accessing through a VPN connection.


●
      
To
 prevent
harm or liability. 
We may use information for security purposes (such
as to investigate security issues or to monitor and prevent fraud) and to
prevent abuse. We may do this to comply with our legal obligations, to protect
an individual’s vital interests, or because we have a legitimate interest in
preventing harm or liability to us and our users. For example, we may use
account, usage, and device information to determine if an entity is engaging in
abusive or unauthorized activity in connection with our services.


●
      
For
 legal
compliance. 
We internally use your information as required by
applicable law, legal process, or regulation. To learn about our practices
regarding 
sharing
 your information with third parties for legal
compliance purposes, see Section 3.1 below. We also use your information to
enforce our legal rights and resolve disputes.


3. Who do we share your information with and why?


3.1. In General


We may disclose your information in the following
circumstances:




●
      
In accordance with your instructions or consent.
 For example,
some services may allow you to register an account using a third party account
(such as a Google or Microsoft account). If you choose to do so, we will share
information with the third party account provider.


●
      
Affiliates and third party service providers.
 
To help
us provide some aspects of our services, we work with our affiliates and
trusted third parties. To protect your data, we enter into appropriate
confidentiality and data processing terms with these third parties, review
their security practices, and limit information sharing to the scope of what
they are helping us with. Examples of activities that third parties help us
with include:


○
      
processing

customer payments


○
      
providing analytics about our services


○
      
providing
 sales and customer support


○
      
maintaining the infrastructure required to provide our services


○
      
delivering our marketing and advertising content


○
      
serving

advertising content


●
      
To
 a new
owner.
 If ownership or control of all or part of our services,
assets, or business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.


●
      
Aggregated
or de-identified data.
 We may use and share aggregated data
and data that is de-identified such that it no longer reveals the identity of
an individual user for regulatory compliance, research and analysis, our own
marketing and advertising activities and other legitimate business purposes.


●
      
To
 comply
with legal process and the law.
 We are fiercely protective of the
privacy of our users. For our VPN products, we protect your privacy by ensuring
that we do not log or record online activities that you conduct over a VPN
connection in any way that can be tied back to you, meaning that we do not have
any data to share with law enforcement and government agencies who make
requests for information about what you were doing through a VPN connection.
Subject to the foregoing, we may share your information if we are required to
do so by applicable law; to comply with our legal obligations; to comply with
legal process; and to respond to valid law enforcement requests relating to a
criminal investigation, or alleged or suspected illegal activity that may
expose us, you, or any of our other users to legal liability. If we share your
information for these purposes, we limit the information shared to what is
legally necessary, and challenge information requests that we believe are
unlawful, overbroad, or otherwise invalid.


●
      
To
 enforce our rights and prevent fraud and abuse.
 We may share
limited amounts of your information to enforce and administer our agreements
with customers and users, and to respond to claims asserted against us. We may
also share your information in order to protect against fraud and abuse against
us, our affiliates, users and others.


3.2. Displaying Advertisements


We may serve ads to users in certain regions. The ads we
display in our services are supplied either by advertisers we have
relationships with or by third party advertising networks such as Google. To
display third party ads in our apps, we integrate into them a software
development kit (SDK), which consists of software code provided by the ad
network.


We provide limited personal data about you to such third
party advertising networks to enable them to provide their services. For
example, some of these advertising networks may collect information through
their SDKs, such as your mobile advertising identifier, IP address, and device
information, for the purpose of serving you with “personalized” ads (ads that
they think are more relevant to you) and measuring your response to those ads.
If you are using a VPN connection, your IP address is hidden from ad networks
and replaced with the IP address of our VPN servers. 


Each advertising network collects this information
according to their privacy policies. Where an 
AdChoices

logo appears on an ad, you can click it to learn more about the ad network that
provided the ad, its privacy policy, and your choices regarding opting out from
any personalized advertising. If you opt out from personalized advertising, you
may still see non-personalized ads.


While we request you not to use ad blockers to prevent
the display of third party ads because that is how we support our free
services, our services are able to continue functioning if you do use ad
blockers.

Tracking Technologies & Cookies


4.1.
About Tracking Technologies


We use various technologies in our services to help us
collect information. For convenience, we refer to these as “tracking
technologies,” although they are not always used to track individuals and the
information collected is in a non-identifiable form that does not reference any
personal data. Tracking technologies include:


Cookies


Cookies are small portions of text that are stored on the
device you use to access our services. Cookies enable us (or third parties that
we allow to set cookies on your device) to recognize repeat users. Cookies may
expire after a period of time, depending on what they are used for.




Pixel Tags / Page Tags / Web Beacons / Tracking Links


These are small, hidden images and blocks of code placed
in web pages, ads, and our emails that allow us to determine if you perform a
specific action. When you access a page, ad, or email, or click a link, these
items let us know that you have accessed that page, opened an email, or clicked
a link.


SDKs


SDKs or software development kits are software code
provided by our business partners that let our software interact with the
services those partners provide. For example, in certain of our mobile apps, we
may use an SDK to enable our app to serve ads from an advertising network.
Sometimes these interactions will involve that business partner collecting some
information from the device on which the software is run.


4.2. Why we use Cookies


We use cookies:


●
      
To
 provide
our services.
 Some cookies are essential for the proper operation of
our services. For example, cookies allow us to authenticate who you are and
whether you’re authorized to access a resource.


●
      
To
 store
your preferences.
 Cookies can store your preferences, such as
language preferences or whether to pre-fill your username on sign in forms. We
may also use them to optimize the content that we show to you.


●
      
For

analytics.
 Cookies are used to inform us how users interact with
our services so we can, as a legitimate interest, improve how they work (such
as what screens or webpages you access, and whether our advertising is
effective).


●
      
For
 security.
 Cookies
can enable us and our payment processors to detect certain kinds of fraud.


●
      
For

advertising-related purposes. 
We advertise our services online with
the help of third parties who show ads and marketing about us on sites around
the internet.


4.3. Third Parties





            We may allow our business partners to place certain tracking technologies in our services. These partners use these technologies for the following purposes:
            




●
      
To
 provide our services.
 Some business partners who help us to provide our services may use these technologies to support those efforts.


●
      
For

Analytics.
 To help us understand how you use our services.


●
      
For

Marketing.
 To help us market and advertise our services to you,
including on third party websites. Cookies are used in connection with this to
measure the performance of our advertising, attribute actions you take with our
ads with actions you take on our services, deliver ad retargeting (serving ads
based on your past interactions with our services), and target ads at similar
audiences.


●
      
To
 Serve
Ads.
 Ad networks may use these technologies to display ads
which they think will be more relevant to you. For more information, please see
the “Displaying Advertisements” section above.


4.4. Your Choices


●
      
Our Cookies:
 Most
web browsers and some mobile devices give you the ability to manage your cookie
preferences, including deleting cookies and blocking cookies from being set on
those browsers or devices. Visit the “help” section of your mobile device to
understand what controls it gives you over cookies. Note that deleting or
blocking certain cookies could adversely impact the proper operation of our
services.


●
      
Third
 Party
Advertising Cookies:
 For information on how to opt out of
personalized or interest-based advertising, you can visit the following pages:

Google Ads Settings page
. These
opt out mechanisms are not provided by us and we are not responsible for the
availability or operation of them. Note that after opting out of personalized advertising
you may still see non-personalized ads.


●
      
Google Analytics: 
We use Google Analytics to help us understand how users
use our services. Google makes available a 
Google Analytics Opt

Out
 Browser Add-On
 if you do not
want to participate in Google Analytics.


5.Security


We employ a range of administrative, organizational,
technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your data against
unauthorized access, loss, or modification. We continuously work to improve
such safeguards.


6.International Data Transfers


We may transfer your personal data to countries other
than the one in which you reside. We do this to facilitate our operations, and
transferees include our group companies, service providers, and partners. Laws
in other countries may be different to those that apply where you reside. For
example, personal data collected within Switzerland, United Kingdom or the
European Economic Area (EEA) may be transferred and processed outside
Switzerland, United Kingdom or the EEA for purposes described in this policy.
However, we put in place appropriate safeguards that help to ensure that such
data receives an adequate level of protection. You may contact us if you would
like more information about such safeguards.


7. Data Retention


We generally retain your personal data for as long as is
needed to provide the services to you, or for as long as you have an account
with us. We may also retain personal data if required by law, or for our
legitimate interests, such as abuse detection and prevention, and defending
ourselves from legal claims. Residual copies of personal data may be stored in
backup systems as a security measure to protect against data loss. Subject to
the foregoing, where your personal data is no longer required, we will ensure
it is either securely deleted or stored in a way that means it will no longer
be usable by us.


8. Your Rights


Depending on your country of residence, you may have
certain legal rights in relation to your personal data that we maintain.
Subject to exceptions and limitations provided by applicable law, these may
include the right to:


●
      
access and
receive a copy of your personal data;


●
      
correct your
personal data;


●
      
restrict the
processing of your personal data;


●
      
object at any
time to the processing of your personal data;


●

personal data erased;


●
      
data

portability;


●
      
withdraw any
consent you previously gave to the processing of your data (such as opting out
to marketing communications);


●
      
lodge a
complaint with a data protection authority;


●
      
request
 that we
provide you with the categories of personal data we collect, disclose or sell
about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or
commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal data; and the
categories of third parties with whom we share personal data. This information
may also be provided in this Privacy Policy.


Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon
your location, and some information may be exempt from certain requests under
applicable law.


You may be able to exercise some of these rights by using
the settings and tools provided in our services. For example, you may be able
to update your user account details via the relevant account settings screen of
our apps. You may also be able to opt out from receiving marketing
communications from us by clicking an “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link in such
communications.


Otherwise, if you wish to exercise any of these rights,
you may contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section below. As
permitted by law, we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further
action on your request.


9. Your
California Privacy Rights


This Section applies solely to California residents. 


9.1. Do
Not Track Signals


We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals
sent by browsers or mobile apps due to a lack of standardization regarding how
that signal should be interpreted. 
Learn more about Do Not Track
.


9.2.
Third Party Disclosure Requests


California law permits users who are California residents
to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third
parties to whom we have disclosed their “personal information” (if any) as
defined under California Civil Code 1798.83 for their direct marketing purposes
in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information
disclosed to those parties. See the “Contact Us” section below for where to
send such requests. Note that we do not share personal information with third
parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent.


9.3 Opt-Out 
From

Sale


You may have the
right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information as defined by the
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The CCPA broadly defines “sale” such
that it may include allowing third parties to receive certain information, e.g.
cookies, to deliver personalized advertising on our services.


We do not “sell”
(as defined by the CCPA) your personal information except in the context of
certain versions of our products that are supported by personalized
advertising. Advertising, including personalized advertising, enables us to
provide certain of our products for free, to provide offers relevant to you,
and, because we believe it’s important that everyone has the opportunity,
regardless of their situation, to have secure and private access to the
internet. Personalized advertising enables ads to be shown that are more
relevant to you.


Depending on the
services you use and how you use them, we may “sell” (as defined by California
law) the following categories of personal information for such advertising
purposes:


●
      
Identifiers (such as advertising
identifiers and cookies)


●
      
Internet or other network or device
activity (such as which of our apps you’re using)


●
      
Approximate
 
geolocation
 information


To opt out of our use of your
information for such purposes, visit:
 
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
. Please
note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors 
under
 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative
authorization.


9.4 Additional Rights


California law
may permit you to request that we:


●
      
provide you the categories of personal
information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months,
the categories of sources of such information, the business or commercial
purpose for collecting or selling your personal information, and the categories
of third parties with whom we shared personal information. This information is
provided in this Notice;


●
      
provide access to, or a copy, of certain
information we hold about you;


●
      
delete certain information we have about you.


You may also
have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we
offer to you (if any), and the right to not be discriminated against (as
provided for in the CCPA) for exercising certain of your rights.


Certain
information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example,
we need certain types of information so that we can provide the services to you
and for compliance with applicable law.


When you
exercise certain rights, we may take reasonable steps to authenticate your
identity before fulfilling your request (such as verifying your email address
or payment instrument). If you ask us to delete certain information, you may no
longer be able to access or use our services.


You are also
permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your
behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the
authorized agent with a signed, written permission to make such requests, or a
power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity
before processing the authorized agent’s request. 


If you would
like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or
would like to exercise any of them, please contact us at the address listed
under the Contact Us section below.

2. How Is Your Information Collected?:
You Provide It to Us
We collect information that you enter on our digital properties or give to us in other ways (e.g., when you contact Guest Relations, order on Target.com, purchase a product in a Target store or create a gift registry).
Automated Information Collection
We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Target Guest. If we are able to identify you as a Target Guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile application(s). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc.
In order to provide the best Guest experience possible and run our business operations, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile application(s), the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.
Third-party Automated Collection
We and our service providers use anonymous identifiers such as cookies and other technologies to collect and store certain types of information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) whenever you interact with us or third-parties that use our services.
We also allow third-party companies (e.g., Google) to place tags on our digital properties once approved through our tagging process. The tags may collect information from your interactions on Target.com. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third party companies. Please contact these third-party companies (e.g., Google) directly for more information about their privacy policy and your choices regarding the tags and the information collected by the tags.  
Social Media Widgets
Our sites and mobile application(s) include social media features, such as the Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about you such as your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site. They may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies to accomplish this. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third-party. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
Mobile Location Information
If you use a mobile device, your device may share location information (when you enable location services) with our websites, mobile application(s), services or our service providers. For example, precise geo-location can be used to help you find nearby Target stores; or, in-store location through the use of your phone’s blue tooth signal, LED light chip technologies or other technologies will permit Target to find nearby products for you, get you real-time deals, auto-sort your shopping list and more.
To manage how you share your device’s location settings, go to the 
 
Choices
 
 section of this privacy policy.
Cameras
We use cameras in and around our stores for operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns and tracking in-stock levels. Cameras may also be used for fraud detection, theft prevention and security. When enabled, we may also use your device’s camera (e.g., Apple’s TrueDepth camera) so you can use services such as product visualization (e.g., see item in your space) or virtual try on services (e.g., try on accessories/beauty products). Information collected from your device’s camera for these services is used in real time and is not stored on the servers. The virtual try on experience operates within your own device or browser and the data is deleted after the experience ends.
Information From Other Sources
We collect information about you from other sources to enhance our existing Guest information and improve the accuracy of our records. This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing.
Back to Top
3. How Is Your Information Used?
Information we collect is used for a variety of purposes, including activities such as: processing transactions, helping our Guest Relations representatives resolve issues, identifying fraud and improving our services. In addition, information we collect improves your experience by delivering more personalized interactions and advertising in digital (e.g., Target.com, mobile app, other online sites) and social media (e.g., Facebook, Pinterest), as well as TV and Video platforms.
We also use information we collect for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores and on our mobile application(s), the performance of our marketing efforts and your response to those marketing efforts.
Our Purposes (including but not limited to marketing)
Deliver coupons, mobile offers newsletters, in-store receipt messages, emails, mobile messages, targeted advertising and social media notifications 
Provide interactive features of the website or mobile application(s), such as product reviews or Weekly Ad, send marketing communications and other information regarding products, services and promotions
Administer promotions, surveys, and focus groups
Cross-context and cross-device linking
 
Interest-based advertising 
Improve Guest experiences 
Conduct research and analysis
Personalize content, including using your image
Perform other business activities as needed, or as described elsewhere in this policy
Product and Service Fulfillment
Fulfill and manage purchases, orders, payments, and returns/exchanges
Respond to requests for information about our products and services in our stores, on our websites or mobile application(s) or to otherwise serve you
Connect with you regarding Guest service via our contact center, Guest service desk, or on social media or internet chat platforms. Chat functionality allows our Guest Relations specialists to see what a Guest is typing before hitting the send button. This allows for quicker response time as our specialists anticipate questions. 
Provide services such as gift registry or a shopping list
Award and fulfill benefits associated with use of our services
Administer sweepstakes and contests
Conduct a transaction where we collect information required by law (for example, pseudoephedrine or age-restricted purchases) 
Allow you to, using our mobile application(s): find a store nearest to your location, show you a map of the store (if available), use our drive up capabilities (where available), add and redeem offers, search for products and check availability, check prices, provide product ratings and reviews, track your orders, scan a UPC barcode or QR code, use voice recognition to add to your list, update information, etc
Cross-Context
We merge data collected from our own websites and mobile application(s). Examples of the data collected include: cookie IDs, device advertising IDs, transaction and browsing history, your interaction with our online and mobile advertisements, including advertisements we serve within our emails and advertisements that we serve on behalf of third parties through Roundel, Target’s in-house media company; information about ads we serve, such as which ad was served, your interactions with the ads, and the URLs where the ads are served by marketing partners such as Google.
For mobile platforms that require opt-in consent to link or track user or device data, unless you consent, Target does not link or track user or device data collected from Target application(s) with user or device data collected from other companies’ applications, websites or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. If a guest provides opt-in consent to the linking and use of data with a specifically identified third party partner, such data may be linked and may be used by Target and/or the third party partner as described at the time consent is obtained, including for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. 
Cross-Device Linking
We may also link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in a relevant experience on another device. This allows us to deliver more personalized and consistent advertising to you. For example, if you purchase a product on our website using your desktop, we are able to avoid showing you an advertisement on the same product on your mobile phone; if you add an item to your cart on Target.com through your mobile device, but leave Target.com without purchasing the item, we are able to show you that item in your cart on another device.
Interest-Based Advertising
We participate in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as online behavioral advertising (OBA). We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. 
We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile application(s). This information is used to serve ads for Target products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites. These companies use non-identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g., static IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie, web beacon or other similar tracking technologies to collect this information. Target adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for IBA.
User Experience Information
In order to improve Guest online and mobile shopping experiences, help with fraud identification, and assist our Guest Relations representatives in resolving issues Guests may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information; including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked, specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g., information entered during checkout process), browser and device information.
Social Media
We engage with Guests on multiple social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request Guest service via social media, or otherwise direct us to communicate with you via social media, we may contact you via direct message or use other social media tools to interact with you. In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this privacy policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use.
Social Media Ads
We may display targeted ads to you through social media platforms. These ads are sent to groups of people who share traits such as likely commercial interests and demographics. For example, we may target people who have expressed an interest in shopping for groceries, cosmetics, clothing, etc. See the policies of each social media platform for additional information about these types of ads.
Prevention of Fraud and Other Harm
Prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft and otherwise protect our Guests and our business (e.g., product recalls)
Legal Compliance
For example, assist law enforcement and respond to legal/regulatory inquiries

If you set your device to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our features. 
To opt-out of the vendors we use for cross-device linking, go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page at www.aboutads.info/choices and perform a global opt-out on each browser and device that you would like to be opted out on. Opting out in this manner means that the browser on the device from which you opt-out will no longer receive information collected on devices linked to it, that devices linked to it will not receive information collected from the opted-out device, and that the vendor will not transfer information collected from the opted-out device to a third-party. Please note that this will not opt you out of cross-device linking or advertising across linked devices based solely on your visits to Target websites or application(s), or your interaction with advertisements for Target delivered by Target.
To opt-out of our interest-based advertising for Target’s goods and services or those of another party, online and in third-party mobile applications, visit Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page 
here
 and perform a global opt-out. Options you select are browser and device specific.  
To learn more about interest-Based Advertising, visit the 
Network Advertising Initiative website
 and the 
Digital Advertising Alliance website
. The opt-out tool described above is cookie-based.  Therefore, the opt-out will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies, and it may not function where cookies are automatically disabled or removed. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again. 
Do Not Track
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals. However, Target treats Global Privacy Control signals as opt-out of sale and opt out of targeted/cross-context behavioral advertising requests under applicable state laws (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act). 
Other Web Site Analytics Services
Analytics services such as Site Catalyst by Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and Crazy Egg provide services that analyze information regarding visits to our websites and mobile application(s). They use cookies, web beacons, recorded interactions and other tracking mechanisms to collect this information.

Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and

1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

How to Exercise Your Rights and Choices.
 If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings. Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above, subject to applicable law, through the contact options set out in 
Section 11
. Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request. Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information. 

Communication Choices.
 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails or through your account settings. Certain communications from Etsy are service-related or legally required and you will continue to receive them even if you opt out of marketing emails.


8. Your Responsibilities


If you are a Seller on our Services or use 
Etsy’s API
, you may receive certain personal information and will have legal obligations in respect of this information.

Etsy Seller Policy
 and the 
Etsy API Terms of Use
.


9. Privacy Policy Changes


We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates.


10. Additional Disclosures for United States Residents


In certain US states, including California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, you may be entitled to additional rights or disclosures. Please see our

How to Contact Us
 




At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. 


This policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the ""
Site
""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy
, Etsy’s public 
Application Programming Interface
 (the “
API
”), and other services provided by Etsy, Inc. or Etsy Ireland UC, depending on your location (which we’ll refer to as ""
Etsy
,"" or as ""
we
,"" ""
us
,"" and ""
our
""). We’ll use the term “
Services
” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API. Learn more about interest-based advertising and your choices 
here
.   


This policy applies to our registered buyers (“
Buyers
”) and sellers (“
Sellers
”) (together, our “
Members
”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“
Guests
”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “
you
” and “
your
”). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your personal information, available 
here
.


This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and 
Section 2
 below.


We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see 
Section 3
. 


If you are located outside of North or South America, Etsy Ireland UC is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. If you are located within North or South America, Etsy, Inc. is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. The contact details for both companies are set out in 
Section 11
.


Other policies that are referenced below, such as the 
Terms of Use
 and 
Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy
, are available from Our House Rules page, located 
here
. 


If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see 
Section 11
 for further information about how to contact us.




1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

How to Exercise Your Rights and Choices.
 If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings. Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above, subject to applicable law, through the contact options set out in 
Section 11
. Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request. Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information. 

Communication Choices.
 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails or through your account settings. Certain communications from Etsy are service-related or legally required and you will continue to receive them even if you opt out of marketing emails.


8. Your Responsibilities


If you are a Seller on our Services or use 
Etsy’s API
, you may receive certain personal information and will have legal obligations in respect of this information. Your privacy responsibilities, including when you act as an independent data controller (someone who decides what personal data to collect and the purpose you use the data for) are laid out in the 
Etsy Seller Policy
 and the 
Etsy API Terms of Use
.


9. Privacy Policy Changes


We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates.


10. Additional Disclosures for United States Residents


In certain US states, including California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, you may be entitled to additional rights or disclosures. Please see our

To enable personalized advertising (like interest-based ads), we may share your data with our marketing and advertising partners using cookies and other technologies. Those partners may have their own information they’ve collected about you. Turning off the personalized advertising setting won’t stop you from seeing Etsy ads, but it may make the ads you see less relevant or more repetitive.

How to Contact Us
 




At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. 


This policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the ""
Site
""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy
, Etsy’s public 
Application Programming Interface
 (the “
API
”), and other services provided by Etsy, Inc. or Etsy Ireland UC, depending on your location (which we’ll refer to as ""
Etsy
,"" or as ""
we
,"" ""
us
,"" and ""
our
""). We’ll use the term “
Services
” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API. Learn more about interest-based advertising and your choices 
here
.   


This policy applies to our registered buyers (“
Buyers
”) and sellers (“
Sellers
”) (together, our “
Members
”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“
Guests
”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “
you
” and “
your
”). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your personal information, available 
here
.


This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and 
Section 2
 below.


We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see 
Section 3
. 


If you are located outside of North or South America, Etsy Ireland UC is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. If you are located within North or South America, Etsy, Inc. is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. The contact details for both companies are set out in 
Section 11
.


Other policies that are referenced below, such as the 
Terms of Use
 and 
Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy
, are available from Our House Rules page, located 
here
. 


If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see 
Section 11
 for further information about how to contact us.




1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

online form
.






Please see the United States Regional Privacy Policy for information about privacy rights provided under certain US state laws.


How to Exercise Your Rights and Choices.
 If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings. Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above, subject to applicable law, through the contact options set out in 
Section 11
. Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request. Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information. 

Communication Choices.
 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails or through your account settings. Certain communications from Etsy are service-related or legally required and you will continue to receive them even if you opt out of marketing emails.


8. Your Responsibilities


If you are a Seller on our Services or use 
Etsy’s API
, you may receive certain personal information and will have legal obligations in respect of this information. Your privacy responsibilities, including when you act as an independent data controller (someone who decides what personal data to collect and the purpose you use the data for) are laid out in the 
Etsy Seller Policy
 and the 
Etsy API Terms of Use
.


9. Privacy Policy Changes


We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates.


10. Additional Disclosures for United States Residents


In certain US states, including California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, you may be entitled to additional rights or disclosures. Please see our

How to Contact Us
 




At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. 


This policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the ""
Site
""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy
, Etsy’s public 
Application Programming Interface
 (the “
API
”), and other services provided by Etsy, Inc. or Etsy Ireland UC, depending on your location (which we’ll refer to as ""
Etsy
,"" or as ""
we
,"" ""
us
,"" and ""
our
""). We’ll use the term “
Services
” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API. Learn more about interest-based advertising and your choices 
here
.   


This policy applies to our registered buyers (“
Buyers
”) and sellers (“
Sellers
”) (together, our “
Members
”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“
Guests
”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “
you
” and “
your
”). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your personal information, available 
here
.


This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and 
Section 2
 below.


We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see 
Section 3
. 


If you are located outside of North or South America, Etsy Ireland UC is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. If you are located within North or South America, Etsy, Inc. is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. The contact details for both companies are set out in 
Section 11
.


Other policies that are referenced below, such as the 
Terms of Use
 and 
Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy
, are available from Our House Rules page, located 
here
. 


If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see 
Section 11
 for further information about how to contact us.




1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state. 


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

online form
.






Please see the United States Regional Privacy Policy for information about privacy rights provided under certain US state laws.


How to Exercise Your Rights and Choices.
 If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings. Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above, subject to applicable law, through the contact options set out in 
Section 11
. Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request. Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information. 

Communication Choices.
 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails or through your account settings. Certain communications from Etsy are service-related or legally required and you will continue to receive them even if you opt out of marketing emails.


8. Your Responsibilities


If you are a Seller on our Services or use 
Etsy’s API
, you may receive certain personal information and will have legal obligations in respect of this information. Your privacy responsibilities, including when you act as an independent data controller (someone who decides what personal data to collect and the purpose you use the data for) are laid out in the 
Etsy Seller Policy
 and the 
Etsy API Terms of Use
.


9. Privacy Policy Changes


We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates.


10. Additional Disclosures for United States Residents


In certain US states, including California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, you may be entitled to additional rights or disclosures. Please see our 
United States Regional Privacy Policy

How to Contact Us
 




At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. 


This policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the ""
Site
""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy
, Etsy’s public 
Application Programming Interface
 (the “
API
”), and other services provided by Etsy, Inc. or Etsy Ireland UC, depending on your location (which we’ll refer to as ""
Etsy
,"" or as ""
we
,"" ""
us
,"" and ""
our
""). We’ll use the term “
Services
” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API. Learn more about interest-based advertising and your choices 
here
.   


This policy applies to our registered buyers (“
Buyers
”) and sellers (“
Sellers
”) (together, our “
Members
”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“
Guests
”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “
you
” and “
your
”). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your personal information, available 
here
.


This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and 
Section 2
 below.


We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see 
Section 3
. 


If you are located outside of North or South America, Etsy Ireland UC is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. If you are located within North or South America, Etsy, Inc. is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. The contact details for both companies are set out in 
Section 11
.


Other policies that are referenced below, such as the 
Terms of Use
 and 
Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy
, are available from Our House Rules page, located 
here
. 


If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see 
Section 11
 for further information about how to contact us.




1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state. 


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

online form
.






Please see the United States Regional Privacy Policy for information about privacy rights provided under certain US state laws.


How to Exercise Your Rights and Choices.
 If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings. Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above, subject to applicable law, through the contact options set out in 
Section 11
. Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request. Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information. 

Communication Choices.
 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails or through your account settings. Certain communications from Etsy are service-related or legally required and you will continue to receive them even if you opt out of marketing emails.


8. Your Responsibilities


If you are a Seller on our Services or use 
Etsy’s API
, you may receive certain personal information and will have legal obligations in respect of this information. Your privacy responsibilities, including when you act as an independent data controller (someone who decides what personal data to collect and the purpose you use the data for) are laid out in the 
Etsy Seller Policy
 and the 
Etsy API Terms of Use
.


9. Privacy Policy Changes


We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates.


10. Additional Disclosures for United States Residents


In certain US states, including California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, you may be entitled to additional rights or disclosures. Please see our

How to Contact Us
 




At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. 


This policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the ""
Site
""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy
, Etsy’s public 
Application Programming Interface
 (the “
API
”), and other services provided by Etsy, Inc. or Etsy Ireland UC, depending on your location (which we’ll refer to as ""
Etsy
,"" or as ""
we
,"" ""
us
,"" and ""
our
""). We’ll use the term “
Services
” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API. Learn more about interest-based advertising and your choices 
here
.   


This policy applies to our registered buyers (“
Buyers
”) and sellers (“
Sellers
”) (together, our “
Members
”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“
Guests
”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “
you
” and “
your
”). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your personal information, available 
here
.


This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and 
Section 2
 below.


We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see 
Section 3
. 


If you are located outside of North or South America, Etsy Ireland UC is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. If you are located within North or South America, Etsy, Inc. is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. The contact details for both companies are set out in 
Section 11
.


Other policies that are referenced below, such as the 
Terms of Use
 and 
Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy
, are available from Our House Rules page, located 
here
. 


If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see 
Section 11
 for further information about how to contact us.




1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

online form
.






Please see the United States Regional Privacy Policy for information about privacy rights provided under certain US state laws.


How to Exercise Your Rights and Choices.
 If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings. Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above, subject to applicable law, through the contact options set out in 
Section 11
. Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request. Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information. 

Communication Choices.
 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails or through your account settings. Certain communications from Etsy are service-related or legally required and you will continue to receive them even if you opt out of marketing emails.


8. Your Responsibilities


If you are a Seller on our Services or use 
Etsy’s API
, you may receive certain personal information and will have legal obligations in respect of this information. Your privacy responsibilities, including when you act as an independent data controller (someone who decides what personal data to collect and the purpose you use the data for) are laid out in the 
Etsy Seller Policy
 and the 
Etsy API Terms of Use
.


9. Privacy Policy Changes


We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates.


10. Additional Disclosures for United States Residents


In certain US states, including California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, you may be entitled to additional rights or disclosures. Please see our

How to Contact Us
 




At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. 


This policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the ""
Site
""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy
, Etsy’s public 
Application Programming Interface
 (the “
API
”), and other services provided by Etsy, Inc. or Etsy Ireland UC, depending on your location (which we’ll refer to as ""
Etsy
,"" or as ""
we
,"" ""
us
,"" and ""
our
""). We’ll use the term “
Services
” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API. Learn more about interest-based advertising and your choices 
here
.   


This policy applies to our registered buyers (“
Buyers
”) and sellers (“
Sellers
”) (together, our “
Members
”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“
Guests
”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “
you
” and “
your
”). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your personal information, available 
here
.


This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and 
Section 2
 below.


We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see 
Section 3
. 


If you are located outside of North or South America, Etsy Ireland UC is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. If you are located within North or South America, Etsy, Inc. is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information.

Section 11
.


Other policies that are referenced below, such as the 
Terms of Use
 and 
Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy
, are available from Our House Rules page, located 
here
. 


If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see 
Section 11
 for further information about how to contact us.




1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

How to Contact Us
 




At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. 


This policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the ""
Site
""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy
, Etsy’s public 
Application Programming Interface
 (the “
API
”), and other services provided by Etsy, Inc. or Etsy Ireland UC, depending on your location (which we’ll refer to as ""
Etsy
,"" or as ""
we
,"" ""
us
,"" and ""
our
""). We’ll use the term “
Services
” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API. Learn more about interest-based advertising and your choices 
here
.   


This policy applies to our registered buyers (“
Buyers
”) and sellers (“
Sellers
”) (together, our “
Members
”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“
Guests
”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “
you
” and “
your
”). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your personal information, available 
here
.


This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and 
Section 2
 below.


We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see 
Section 3
. 


If you are located outside of North or South America, Etsy Ireland UC is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. If you are located within North or South America, Etsy, Inc. is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. The contact details for both companies are set out in 
Section 11
.


Other policies that are referenced below, such as the 
Terms of Use
 and 
Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy
, are available from Our House Rules page, located 
here
. 


If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see 
Section 11
 for further information about how to contact us.




1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article

How to Contact Us
 




At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. 


This policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the ""
Site
""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy
, Etsy’s public 
Application Programming Interface
 (the “
API
”), and other services provided by Etsy, Inc. or Etsy Ireland UC, depending on your location (which we’ll refer to as ""
Etsy
,"" or as ""
we
,"" ""
us
,"" and ""
our
""). We’ll use the term “
Services
” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API. Learn more about interest-based advertising and your choices 
here
.   


This policy applies to our registered buyers (“
Buyers
”) and sellers (“
Sellers
”) (together, our “
Members
”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“
Guests
”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “
you
” and “
your
”). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your personal information, available 
here
.


This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:




Our mission at Etsy is to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. We connect Buyers with Sellers that offer handmade or vintage products and craft supplies. By accepting our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand this policy, including how and why we use your information.


We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about what information we collect and how we use it, see 
Section 1
 and 
Section 2
 below.


We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see 
Section 3
. 


If you are located outside of North or South America, Etsy Ireland UC is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. If you are located within North or South America, Etsy, Inc. is the service provider and data controller responsible for your personal information. The contact details for both companies are set out in 
Section 11
.


Other policies that are referenced below, such as the 
Terms of Use
 and 
Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy
, are available from Our House Rules page, located 
here
. 


If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see 
Section 11
 for further information about how to contact us.




1. What Information We Collect and Receive


In the course of providing our Services, we collect and receive information that directly or indirectly relates to you (which we call your “
personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates.

""), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the ""
Apps
""), 
Etsy Payments
, 
Pattern by Etsy

This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (including Sellers, Pattern by Etsy users or API users) who you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them. 


It is important that you understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points and references to help you navigate the policy are:

personal information
”) in different ways and from different sources, which we have set out below. The capitalized terms in this 
Section 1
 are definitions that we use throughout this Policy, so please refer back to this table as necessary.


















2. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis


When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“
EEA
”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“
UK
”) (together referred to as the “
European Region
”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.




























3. How We Share Your Information


We share your data with third parties where necessary to perform the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:


Publicly Displayed Information:
 By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in 
Section 2
). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. Other information connected with your use of the Services will also be publicly displayed, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review, photos or videos of items you purchased, your saved product listings that are grouped by you (“
Favorites and Collections
”), , followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and search engines, including Google.  


For Sellers, some additional information will be publicly displayed. For example, your shop name or or business name associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) is publicly displayed.


Etsy Group Companies:
 We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy UK, Ltd., and other Etsy entities that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “
Etsy Group Companies
”). We do not share your personal information with our sister companies like Depop, Elo7 or Reverb. The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring and payment processing or to provide customer support, facilitate business development, administer user accounts or provide IT, technical and engineering support.


Sellers:
 We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps.


Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:
 Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.  


You may also link your bank account or payment method to pay for purchases (or receive payment, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third-party will share with Etsy.


Business Partners:
 Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our shipping and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our 
Terms of Use
. When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we, or they, may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them. 


Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities and Regulators:
 We share your information described in 
Section 3
 with our advisors and consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, and industry partners (for example, trade groups) to:




comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process or government requests; 


detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s 
Terms of Use
, and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or 


protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.




Business Reorganization:
 In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.


Community Services:
 We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our 
Community Policy
.


Service Providers:
 Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:








4. How We Transfer Your Information


Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:


Adequacy Decisions

Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available 
here
 via the European Commission website.


Standard Contractual Clauses

Otherwise, we primarily rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.


Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users

You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (our 
Terms of Use
), we transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA


5. How We Protect Your Information


The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.


We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s 
Privacy Policy
 and 
Terms of Use
.


6. How Long We Store Your Information


Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations under national applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable.


The following factors typically affect the retention period:


Necessity for the provision of our Services

We keep your information as long as is necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.


Consent-based processing of personal data

If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.


Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations

Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws or our Know Your Customer (“KYC”) obligations.


Here's what we consider when we deciding how long to keep your information: 








7.  Your Rights and Choices


Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their personal information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the following:




Right to Access:
 You can access certain personal information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format, as well as information explaining how that information is used. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Portability:
 You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.


Right to Correction:
 You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and change certain personal information associated with your account.


Right to Restrict Processing:
 In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.


Right to Deletion:
 In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this 
Help Center article
 for more information.


Right to Object:
 If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. 


Right to Withdraw Consent:
 Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using, for example, an email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share your precise device location details with us, you can revoke that consent through the settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to generally permanently close your account and delete your personal information. Please be aware that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Right to File a Complaint:
 If you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal information with the supervisory authority of your country or state.

How to Exercise Your Rights and Choices.
 If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Etsy account settings. Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above, subject to applicable law, through the contact options set out in 
Section 11
. Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will confirm receipt of your request. Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information. 

Communication Choices.
 You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails or through your account settings. Certain communications from Etsy are service-related or legally required and you will continue to receive them even if you opt out of marketing emails.


8. Your Responsibilities


If you are a Seller on our Services or use 
Etsy’s API
, you may receive certain personal information and will have legal obligations in respect of this information. Your privacy responsibilities, including when you act as an independent data controller (someone who decides what personal data to collect and the purpose you use the data for) are laid out in the 
Etsy Seller Policy
 and the 
Etsy API Terms of Use
.


9. Privacy Policy Changes


We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. We encourage you to check back regularly and review any updates.


10. Additional Disclosures for United States Residents


In certain US states, including California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, you may be entitled to additional rights or disclosures. Please see our
